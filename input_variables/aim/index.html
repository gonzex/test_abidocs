Bader charge is 12.0357,  while it should be exactly 12 (10 core electrons and 2 valence electrons). The error is mostly due to insufficient angular sampling (only 5 theta and 5 phi in an octant). Going to (10, 10) gives 11.9928, and (20, 20) gives 11.9980. But in the latter case, the CPU time required is multiplied by about 10 when compared to the present setting.">tests/v4/Input/t31.in</a>, <a class="wikilink" data-placement="auto bottom" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" href="../../tests/v4/Input/t33.in" title="MgO molecule,  Bader analysis. Examine the Oxygen atom only. Determine 2 bonding critical points (only !), 8 ring critical points,  and 8 cage critical points. (In agreement with Euler's relation : #BCP-#RCP+#CCP=2) The ecut that was used in test case 32 is quite low,  so that the accuracy of the critical points is not too good. Especially,  symmetries are broken at the level of 0.0003. Get 2 core electrons,  6.8043 valence electrons. The nucleus charge is +8. The Oxygen atom-in-molecule has a net charge of -0.8043. Additional explanation about the weak number of BCP for oxygen. One might expect the O atom to be connected through the other O atoms in neighbouring cells (x and y directions - hence 4 BCPs in these directions),  but one sees that the only existing BCPs are towards the Mg atoms. This is surprising,  but correct ! Indeed, the density at the middle of the segment between two O atoms along x (or y) is LOWER than the density at the middle of the segment between two Mg atoms along x (or y). Indeed,  although the O atoms attract electrons from the Mg atoms,  they become negatively charged,  and the potential, in DISTANT regions of the molecule,  is lower (so more attractive) on the side of the Mg atoms than on the side of the O atoms ! This means that the tail of the density extends further in the x-y plane containing the Mg atoms,  than in the x-y plane containing the O atoms. So,  the middle of the segment connecting the O atoms actually belongs to the Mg basin of attraction,  and is close to a Cage Critical Point shared by Oxygen and Magnesium atoms. By contrast,  the middle of the segment connecting the Mg atoms is,  as expected, close to a Bond Critical Point.">tests/v4/Input/t33.in</a>, <a class="wikilink" data-placement="auto bottom" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" href="../../tests/v4/Input/t34.in" title="MgO molecule,  Bader analysis. Examine the Magnesium atom only. This is a pathological case for the currently implemented algorithm : the Bader volume is not convex ! Determine correctly 6 bonding critical points, but only finds 4 ring critical points,  and not even one cage critical point ! (Euler's relation #BCP-#RCP+#CCP=2 is fulfilled,  but the number of RCP or CCP is not right) Despite that fact that the critical points are not all found,  one can proceed with the other steps of the Bader approach : the CP are only used to get an estimation of the minimal and maximal radii of the Bader surface ! Get 9.8533 core electrons,  1.3388 valence electrons, for a total of 11.1922 electrons. The nucleus charge is +12. The Magnesium atom-in-molecule has a net charge of -0.8078 . Comparing with case 33,  one sees that the charge neutrality is violated at the level of 0.0035 electron charge. This is quite good,  but a bit lucky. For a better charge neutrality,  one has to integrate better on the angles phi and theta (increase nphi and ntheta),  and also to increase the ecut of the preliminary abinit run. In any case,  with the pathology of the Mg Bader volume (being not convex),  one will miss some charge. It should be pretty small,  and might even be neglected for all practical purposes (the Bader analysis is just a trend analysis,  anyhow) Nevertheless,  in this particular case of the MgO molecule,  there is a fundamental limit of this algorithm...">tests/v4/Input/t34.in</a></li>

of the pairs~atom-neighbor; then CP(3,1) from the center between two CP(3,-1)

Popeliers's algorithm is used. The difference between the two is based in the
fact that the standard version makes the test if the CP is really on the Bader
surface of the calculated atom for each CP, while the simplified version does
this only for CP(3,-1). When CP analysis is rather fast (with respect to
surface determination), 2 is recommended. In all cases the number of neighbors

<p>If two "numerically different" critical points are separated by less than
<strong>dpclim</strong>, they are considered to be the same critical point. This often
happens because of numerical inaccuracies : one CP might be "seen" by two
different finite elements. The default should be OK when the ecut is quite
large, on the order of 60 Hartree. For less accurate calculations of the
density, increase the default value to 5.d-2, let's say.</p>

The coordinates are rather inaccurate. In particular,  the symmetry between RCP is broken. This is seen the most clearly at the level of the laplacian eigenvalues. This breaking of symmetry naturally originates from the fact that the FFT grid is not symmetric (the lattice was chosen primitive FCC), so that the finite elements used for the interpolation are also not symmetric. This cannot be improved by just tuning the numerical parameters. Instead,  one should consider the Bader analysis in a FCC conventional cell,  instead of the primitive one.

<p>The first estimation of the smallest radius of the basin of the atom (the
distance at which the procedure that follows the gradient path announces that
the gradient path finishes in the corresponding atom) This parameter is very
important for the speed of the calculation, but this first estimation is not
usually used because the program makes a new one based on the knowledge of
CPs. In fact after the CP analysis, the new estimation is done by the product
of the ad hoc parameter <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/aim/#coff1">coff1</a> (default 0.98) by the distance of the
nearest bonding CP. If there is a problem later, <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/aim/#coff2">coff2</a> (default 0.95)
is used instead.</p>

Additional explanation about the weak number of BCP for oxygen. One might expect the O atom to be connected through the other O atoms in neighbouring cells (x and y directions - hence 4 BCPs in these directions),  but one sees that the only existing BCPs are towards the Mg atoms. This is surprising,  but correct ! Indeed, the density at the middle of the segment between two O atoms along x (or y) is LOWER than the density at the middle of the segment between two Mg atoms along x (or y). Indeed,  although the O atoms attract electrons from the Mg atoms,  they become negatively charged,  and the potential, in DISTANT regions of the molecule,  is lower (so more attractive) on the side of the Mg atoms than on the side of the O atoms ! This means that the tail of the density extends further in the x-y plane containing the Mg atoms,  than in the x-y plane containing the O atoms. So,  the middle of the segment connecting the O atoms actually belongs to the Mg basin of attraction,  and is close to a Cage Critical Point shared by Oxygen and Magnesium atoms.
