<h3 id="_1"><a class="headerlink" href="#_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>_Before beginning, you might consider to work in a different subdirectory as
for the other lessons. Why not create &ldquo;Work_rf1&rdquo; in
~abinit/tests/tutorespfn/Input ? _  </p>
<p>NOTE : the reference directory that contains the example files for the
tutorial is no more ~abinit/tests/tutorial (as for the basic lessons and the
specialized, non-response ones), but ~abinit/tests/tutorespfn . This will be
the case for all the response-function based part of the tutorial.</p>
<p>The file ~abinit/tests/tutorespfn/Input/trf1_x.files lists the file names and
root names. You can copy it in the Work_rf1 directory (and change it, as
usual). Note that two pseudopotentials are mentioned in this &ldquo;files&rdquo; file: one
for the Aluminum atom, and one for the Arsenic atom. The first to be
mentioned, for Al, will define the first type of atom. The second to be
mentioned, for As, will define the second type of atom. It might the first
time that you encounter this situation (more than one type of atoms) in the
tutorials, at variance with the four &ldquo;basic&rdquo; lessons.</p>
<p>You can also copy the file ~abinit/tests/tutorespfn/Input/trf1_1.in in
Work_rf1. This is your input file. You should edit it, and read it carefully.</p>
<p>Because of the use of two types of atoms, have a look at the following input
variables :</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#ntypat">ntypat</a> </li>
<li><a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#typat">typat</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the value of <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#tolvrs">tolvrs</a> is rather stringent. This is because the
wavefunctions determined by the present run will be used later as starting
point of the response-function calculation. However, the number of steps,
<a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#nstep">nstep</a>, in this example file has been set to 15, and you will see that this
is not enough to reach the target <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#tolvrs">tolvrs</a>. In production runs, you should
choose a larger value of <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#nstep">nstep</a>, sufficient to reach your target
<a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#tolvrs">tolvrs</a>. In the present tutorial, due to portability concerns related to
automatic testing, we could not allow a larger <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#nstep">nstep</a> value. This minor
problem with some tutorial examples was mentioned briefly in <a href="../lesson_base1.html#aq1">a side note to
the answer to question 1 of lesson 1</a>. So, do not
follow blindly all examples in the tutorials : check by yourself the
convergence of your runs !</p>
<p>You will work at fixed <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#ecut">ecut</a> (=3Ha) and k-point grid, defined by
<a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargs/#kptrlatt">kptrlatt</a> (the 8x8x8 Monkhorst-Pack grid). It is implicit that in &ldquo;real
life&rdquo;, you should do a convergence test with respect to both convergence
parameters. We postpone the discussion of the accuracy of these choices and
the choice of pseudopotential to the end of the fifth section of this
tutorial. They give acceptable results, not very accurate, but, more
important, the speed is reasonable for a tutorial.  </p>
<p>You should make the run (a few seconds), and obtain the following value for
the energy, in the final echo section :</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span> etotal   -9.7626837450E+00
</pre></div>


<p>However, we will rely later on a more accurate (more digits) value of this
total energy, that can be found about a dozen of lines before this final echo
:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Etotal= -9.76268374500280E+00
</pre></div>


<p>The output file also mentions that the forces on both atoms vanish.</p>
<p>The run that you just made will be considered as defining a ground-state
configuration, on top of which response functions will be computed. The main
output of this ground-state run is the wavefunction file trf1_1o_WFK, that you
can already rename as trf1_1i_WFK. Indeed, it will be used in the next runs,
as an input file. <strong>So, in the corresponding &ldquo;files&rdquo; file for all the
following runs, at third line, pay attention TO KEEP &ldquo;trf1_1i&rdquo;, even if you
change the root name for output files (fourth line) to &ldquo;trf1_2o&rdquo; or &ldquo;trf1_3o&rdquo;,
as well as the first, second and fifth lines of this file.</strong></p>

<h3 id="_2"><a class="headerlink" href="#_2" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We will now aim at computing the second derivative of the total energy with
respect to an atomic displacement by different means. For that purpose, you
must first read <a href="../../../users/generated_files/help_respfn.html#0">sections 0 and the first paragraph of section
1</a> of the respfn_help file
(the auxiliary help file, that deals specifically with the response function
features).</p>
<p>We will explain later, in more detail, the signification of the different
input parameters introduced in section 1 of the respfn_help file.</p>
<p>For now, in order to be able to perform a direct comparison with the result of
a response-function calculation, we choose as a perturbation the displacement
of the Al atom along the first axis of the reduced coordinates.</p>
<p>You can copy the file ~abinit/tests/tutorespfn/Input/trf1_2.in in Work_rf1.
This is your input file. You should edit it and briefly look at the two
changes with respect to the file ~abinit/tests/tutorespfn/Input/trf1_1.in :
the change of <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#xred">xred</a>, and the reading of the wavefunction file, using the
<a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varfil/#irdwfk">irdwfk</a> input variable. Then, you can make the run. The symmetry is lowered
with respect to the ground-state geometry, so that the number of k-points
increases a lot, and of course, the CPU time.</p>
<p>From this run, it is possible to get the values of the total energy, and the
value of the gradient of the total energy (dE) with respect to change of
reduced coordinate (dt):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span> rms dE/dt=  3.5517E-03; max dE/dt=  5.0079E-03; dE/dt below (all hartree)
    1       0.005007937776      0.002526310510      0.002526310510
    2      -0.005007879256     -0.002526283046     -0.002526283046
 ...
    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Etotal= -9.76268124105767E+00
</pre></div>


<p>The change of reduced coordinate of the Al atom along the first axis was
rather small (1/1000), and we can make an estimate of the second derivative of
the total energy with respect to the reduced coordinate thanks to finite-
difference formulas.</p>
<p>We start first from the total-energy difference. The total energy is symmetric
with respect to that perturbation, so that it has no linear term. The
difference between the ground-state value (-9.76268374500280E+00 hartree) of
the previous run, and the perturbed value (-9.76268124105767E+00 hartree) of
the present one, is thus one half of the square of the coordinate change
(1/1000) times the second derivative of total energy (2DTE). From these
number, the 2DTE is 5.0078902589 hartree.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can start from the reduced gradients. The value of the
reduced gradient with respect to a displacement of the Al atom along the first
reduced axis is 0.005007937776 (hartree). At first order, this quantity is the
product of the 2DTE by the reduced coordinate difference. The estimate of the
2DTE is thus 5.007937776 hartree. The agreement with the other estimate is
rather good (4.10^-5 Hartree).</p>
<p>However, it is possible to do much better, thanks to the use of a higher-order
finite-difference formula. For this purpose, one can perform another
calculation, in which the change of reduced coordinate along the first axis is
0.002, instead of 0.001. The doubling of the perturbation allows for a rather
simple higher-order estimation, as we will see later. The results of this
calculation are as follows :</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span> rms dE/dt=  7.1249E-03; max dE/dt=  1.0016E-02; dE/dt below (all hartree)
    1       0.010016307568      0.005097516146      0.005097516146
    2      -0.010016187598     -0.005097463261     -0.005097463261
 ...
</pre></div>


<p>From these data, taking into account that the perturbation was twice stronger,
the same procedure as above leads to the values 5.00800219 hartree (from
finite difference of energy) and 5.008153784 hartree (from finite difference
of forces, the value 0.010016307568 has to be multiplied by 1000/2). The
combination of these data with the previous estimate can be done thanks to an
higher-order finite-difference formula, in which the difference of estimations
(the largest perturbation minus the smallest one) is divided by three, and
then subtracted from the smallest estimation. As far as the total-energy
estimation is concerned, the difference is 0.00011194 Ha, which divided by
three, and subtracted from 5.00789025 hartree, gives 5.00785294 hartree. The
same higher-order procedure for force estimates gives 5.0078657 hartree. So,
the agreement between total-energy estimate and force estimate of the 2DTE can
be observed up to the 6th digit, inclusive.</p>
<p>Before comparing this result with the 2DTE directly computed from the
response-function capabilities of ABINIT, a last comment is in order. One can
observe that the action-reaction law is fulfilled only approximately by the
system. Indeed, the force created on the second atom, should be exactly equal
in magnitude to the force on the first atom. The values of dE/dt, mentioned
above show a small, but non-negligible difference between the two atoms. As an
example, for the doubled perturbation, there is a difference in the absolute
values of the first component of the reduced force, 0.010016307568 and
-0.010016187598. Actually, the forces should cancel each other exactly if the
translation symmetry were perfect. This is not the case, but the breaking of
this symmetry can be shown to arise <strong>only</strong> from the presence of the
exchange-correlation grid of points. This grid does not move when atoms are
displaced, and so there is a very small variation of the total energy when the
system is moved as a whole. It is easy to restore the action-reaction law, by
subtracting from every force component the mean of the forces on all atoms.
This is actually done when the gradient with respect to reduced coordinates
are transformed into forces, and specified in cartesian coordinates, as can be
seen in the output file for the small displacement :</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span> cartesian forces (hartree/bohr) at end:
    1     -0.00001684560079    -0.00094403841497    -0.00094403841497
    2      0.00001684560079     0.00094403841497     0.00094403841497
</pre></div>


<p>This effect will be seen also at the level of 2DTE. The so-called &ldquo;acoustic
sum rule&rdquo;, imposing that the frequency of three modes (called acoustic modes)
tend to zero with vanishing wavevector, will also be slightly broken. In this
case also, it will be rather easy to reimpose the acoustic sum rule. In any
case, taking a finer XC grid will allow one to reduce this effect.</p>

<p>We now compute the second derivative of the total energy with respect to the

<p>You can copy the file ~abinit/tests/tutorespfn/Input/trf1_3.in in Work_rf1.
This is your input file. You should examine it. The changes with respect to
the file ~abinit/tests/tutorespfn/Input/trf1_1.in are all gathered in the
first part of this file, before</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>#######################################################################
#Common input variables
</pre></div>


<p>Accordingly, you should get familiarized with the new input variables :
<a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varrf/#rfphon">rfphon</a>, <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varrf/#rfatpol">rfatpol</a>, <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varrf/#rfdir">rfdir</a>. Then, pay attention to the special use of
the <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#kptopt">kptopt</a> input variable. It will be explained in more detail later.</p>
<p>When you have understood the purpose of the input variable values specified
before the &ldquo;Common input variables&rdquo; section, you can make the code run.</p>
<p>Then, we need to analyze the different output files. For that purpose, you
should read the content of the <a href="../../../users/generated_files/help_respfn.html#6"> section
6</a> of the respfn_help file.
Read it quickly, as we will come back to the most important points hereafter.</p>
<p>ABINIT has created four different files :</p>
<ul>
<li>trf1_3.log (the log file) </li>
<li>trf1_3.out (the output file) </li>
<li>trf1_3o_1WF1 (the 1st-order wavefunction file) </li>
<li>trf1_3o_DDB (the derivative database) </li>
</ul>
<p>Let us have a look at the output file. You can follow the description provided
in the <a href="../../../users/generated_files/help_respfn.html#6.2"> section 6.2</a> of the
respfn_help file. You should be able to find the place where the iterations
for the minimisation (with respect to the unique perturbation) take place :</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>      iter   2DEtotal(Ha)       deltaE(Ha) residm    vres2

</pre></div>


<p>From these data, you can see that the 2DTE determined by the response-function
technique is in excellent agreement with the higher-order finite-difference
values for the 2DTE, determined in the previous section : 5.007855 hartree
from the energy differences, and 5.007852 hartree from the force differences.</p>
<p>Now, you can read the remaining of the <a href="../../../users/generated_files/help_respfn.html#6.2"> section
6.2</a> of the respfn_help
file. Then, you should also edit the trf1_3o_DDB file, and read the
corresponding <a href="../../../users/generated_files/help_respfn.html#6.5"> section 6.5</a>
of the respfn_help file.</p>
<p>Finally, the excellent agreement between the finite-difference formula and the
response-function approach calls for some accuracy considerations. These can
be found in <a href="../../../users/generated_files/help_respfn.html#7"> section 7</a> of
the respfn_help file.</p>

<h3 id="446-response-function-calculation-of-the-dynamical-matrix-at-gamma"><strong>4. Response-function calculation of the dynamical matrix at Gamma.</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#446-response-function-calculation-of-the-dynamical-matrix-at-gamma" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<h3 id="_4"><a class="headerlink" href="#_4" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We are now in the position to compute the full dynamical matrix at Gamma
(q=0). You can copy the file ~abinit/tests/tutorespfn/Input/trf1_4.in in
Work_rf1. This is your input file. You should edit it. As for test rf1_3, the
changes with respect to the file ~abinit/tests/tutorespfn/Input/trf1_1.in are
all gathered in the first part of this file. Moreover, the changes with
respect to trf1_3.in concern only the input variables <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varrf/#rfatpol">rfatpol</a>, and
<a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varrf/#rfdir">rfdir</a>. Namely, all the atoms will be displaced, in all the directions.</p>
<p>There are six perturbations to consider. So, one might think that the CPU time
will raise accordingly. This is not true, as ABINIT is able to determine which
perturbations are the symmetric of another perturbation, see <a href="../../../users/generated_files/help_respfn.html#3"> section
3</a> of the respfn_help file.</p>
<p>Now, you can make the run. You edit the file trf1_4.out, and notice that the
response to two perturbations were computed explicitly, while the response to
the other four could be deduced by using the symmetries.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span> The list of irreducible perturbations for this q vector is:
    1)    idir= 1    ipert=   1
    2)    idir= 1    ipert=   2
</pre></div>


<p>Nothing mysterious : one of the two irreducible perturbations is for the Al
atom, placed in a rather symmetric local site, and the other perturbation is
for the As atom.</p>
<p>The phonon frequencies, obtained by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix (where
the atomic masses have been taken into account, see <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varrlx/#amu">amu</a>), are given as
follows :</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  Phonon wavevector (reduced coordinates) :  0.00000  0.00000  0.00000

</pre></div>


<p><em>You might wonder about the dash sign present in the first column of the two
lines giving the frequencies in cm-1. The first column of the main ABINIT
output files is always dedicated to signs needed to automatically treat the
comparison with respect to reference files. Except if you become a ABINIT
developer, you should ignore these signs. In the present case, they should not
be interpreted as a minus sign for the floating numbers that follow them.</em></p>
<p>There is a good news about this result, and a bad news. The good news is that
there are indeed three acoustic modes, with frequency rather close to zero
(less than 1 cm^-1, which is rather good !). The bad news comes when the three
other frequencies are compared with experimental results, or other theoretical
results. Indeed, in the present run, one obtains three degenerate modes, while
there should be a (2+1) splitting. This can be seen in the paper  Ab initio
calculation of phonon dispersions in semiconductors, by P. Giannozzi, S. de
Gironcoli, P. Pavone and S. Baroni, Phys. Rev. B 43, 7231 (1991) , especially
Fig. 2.</p>
<p>Actually, we have forgotten to take into account the coupling between atomic
displacements and the homogeneous electric field, that exists in the case of
polar insulators, for so-called &ldquo;Longitudinal Optic (LO) modes&rdquo;. A splitting
appears between these modes and the &ldquo;Transverse Optic (TO) modes&rdquo;. This
splitting (Lyddane-Sachs-Teller LO-TO splitting) is presented in simple terms
in standard textbooks, and should not be forgotten in doing Ab initio
calculations of phonon frequencies.</p>
<p>Thus we have now to treat correctly the homogeneous electric field type
perturbation.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="546-response-function-calculation-of-the-effect-of-an-homogeneous">**5. Response-function calculation of the effect of an homogeneous<a class="headerlink" href="#546-response-function-calculation-of-the-effect-of-an-homogeneous" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>

<h3 id="_5"><a class="headerlink" href="#_5" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The treatment of the homogeneous electric field perturbation is formally much
more complex than the treatment of atomic displacements. This is primarily
because the change of potential associated with an homogeneous electric field
is not periodic, and thus does not satisfy the Born-von Karman periodic
boundary conditions.</p>
<p>For the purpose of the present tutorial, one should read the section II.C of
the above-mentioned paper  P. Giannozzi, S. de Gironcoli, P. Pavone and S.
Baroni, Phys. Rev. B 43, 7231 (1991) . The reader will find in  X. Gonze,
Phys. Rev. B 55, 10337 (1997) and  X. Gonze and C. Lee, Phys. Rev. B 55, 10355
(1997) more detailed information of this perturbation, closely related to the
ABINIT implementation. There is also an extensive discussion of the Born
effective charges by  Ph. Ghosez, J.-P. Michenaud and X. Gonze, Phys. Rev. B
58, 6224 (1998).</p>
<p>In order to compute the response of solids to an homogeneous electric field,
as implemented in ABINIT, the remaining sections of the respfn_help file
should be read. These sections also present the information needed to compute
phonons with non-zero q wavevector, which will be the subject of the next
section of the present tutorial. The sections to be read are :</p>
<ul>
<li>the part of <a href="../../../users/generated_files/help_respfn.html#1">section 1</a> that had not yet been read </li>
<li><a href="../../../users/generated_files/help_respfn.html#2">section 2</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../users/generated_files/help_respfn.html#4">section 4</a></li>
<li>and, for completeness,<a href="../../../users/generated_files/help_respfn.html#5">section 5</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>You are now in the position to compute the full dynamical matrix at Gamma
(q=0), including the coupling with an homogeneous electric field. You can copy
the file ~abinit/tests/tutorespfn/Input/trf1_5.in in Work_rf1. This is your
input file. You should edit it. As for the other RF tests, the changes with
respect to the file ~abinit/tests/tutorespfn/Input/trf1_1.in are all gathered
in the first part of this file. Unlike the other tests, however, the multi-
dataset mode was used, computing from scratch the ground-state properties,
then computing the effect of the ddk perturbation, then the effect of all
other perturbations (electric field as well as atomic displacements).</p>
<p>The analysis of the output file is even more cumbersome than the previous
ones. Let us skip the first dataset. In the dataset 2 section, one
perturbation is correctly selected :</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span> ==&gt;  initialize data related to q vector &lt;==

 The list of irreducible perturbations for this q vector is:
    1)    idir= 1    ipert=   3

</pre></div>


<p>The analysis of the output for this particular perturbation is not
particularly interesting, except for the f-sum rule ratio</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span> loper3 : ek2=    1.6833336546E+01
          f-sum rule ratio=    1.0028582975E+00
</pre></div>


<p>that should be close to 1, and becomes closer to it when <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#ecut">ecut</a> is
increased, and the sampling of k points is improved. (In the present status of
ABINIT, the f-rule ratio is not computed correctly when <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varrlx/#ecutsm">ecutsm</a>/=0)</p>
<p>In the third dataset section, three irreducible perturbations are considered :</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span> ==&gt;  initialize data related to q vector &lt;==

 The list of irreducible perturbations for this q vector is:

    3)    idir= 1    ipert=   4
</pre></div>


<p>Much later, the dielectric tensor is given :</p>

<p>It is diagonal and isotropic, and corresponds to a dielectric constant of
9.7606052146.</p>
<p>Then, the Born effective charges are given, either computed from the
derivative of the wavefunctions with respect to the electric field, or
computed from the derivative of the wavefunctions with respect to an atomic
displacement, as explained in section II of X. Gonze, Phys. Rev. B55, 10355
(1997) :</p>

<p>Namely, the Born effective charge of the Al atom is 2.104, and the one of the
As atom is -2.127 . The charge neutrality sum rule is not fulfilled exactly.
When <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#ecut">ecut</a> is increased, and the sampling of k points is improved, the sum

<p>The first few lines discard any effect of the homogeneous electric field,
while the next sections consider it along the three cartesian coordinates.</p>
<p>In the present material, the directionality of the electric field has no
influence. We note that there are still three acoustic mode, below 1cm^-1,
while the optic modes have the correct degeneracies : two TO modes at 344.3
cm^-1, and one LO mode at 379.6 cm^-1 .</p>
<p>These values can be compared to experimental (361 cm^-1 , 402 cm^-1) as well
as theoretical (363 cm^-1 , 400 cm^-1) values (again the Gianozzi et al paper
mentioned above). Most of the discrepancy comes from the too low value of
<a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#ecut">ecut</a>. Using ABINIT with <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#ecut">ecut</a>=6 hartree gives (358.8 cm^-1 , 389.8
cm^-1). The remaining of the discrepancy may come partly from the
pseudopotentials, that are particularly soft.</p>
<p>The comparison of Born effective charges is also interesting. After imposition
of the neutrality sum rule, the Al Born effective charge is 2.116 . The value
from Gianozzi et al is 2.17, the experimental value is 2.18. Increasing
<a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#ecut">ecut</a> to 6 hartree in ABINIT gives 2.168.</p>
<p>For the dielectric tensor, it is more delicate. The value from Gianozzi et al
is 9.2, while the experimental value is 8.2 . The agreement is not very good,
a fact that can be attributed to the LDA lack of polarization-dependence ( X.
Gonze, Ph. Ghosez and R. Godby, Phys. Rev. Lett. (1995)). Still, the agreement
of our calculation with the theoretical result is not very good. With
<a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#ecut">ecut</a>=3 hartree, we have 9.76. Changing it to 6 hartree gives 10.40 . A
better k point sampling (8x8x8), with <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#ecut">ecut</a>=6 hartree, reduces the value to
9.89 . Changing pseudopotentials finally improves the agreement : with the
much harder 13al.pspgth and 33as.psphgh pseudopotentials with adequate
<a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#ecut">ecut</a>=16 hartree and 8x8x8 Monkhorst-Pack sampling, we reach a value of
9.37 . This illustrates that the dielectric tensor is a much more sensitive
quantity than the others.</p>

Response-function calculation of phonon frequencies at non-zero q.</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#646-response-function-calculation-of-phonon-frequencies-at-non-zero-q" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>

<p>The computation of phonon frequencies at non-zero q is actually simpler than
the one at Gamma. One must distinguish two cases. Either the q wavevector
connects k points that belong to the same grid, or the wavevector q is
general. In any case, the computation within the response-function formalism
is more efficient than using the frozen-phonon technique: the use of supercell
is completely avoided. For an explanation of this fact, see for example
section IV of X. Gonze, Phys. Rev. B55, 10337 (1997).</p>
<p>You can copy the file ~abinit/tests/tutorespfn/Input/trf1_6.in in Work_rf1.
This is your input file. You should edit it. As for the other RF tests, the
changes with respect to the file ~abinit/tests/tutorespfn/Input/trf1_1.in are
all gathered in the first part of this file. The multi-dataset mode is used,
computing from scratch the ground-state properties, then computing different
dynamical matrices. The run is about 2 minutes on a 2.8 GHz machine. So, you
would better leave your computer running, and either read more of the ABINIT
documentation (why not the
<a href="../../../users/generated_files/help_mrgddb.html">mrgddb_help</a> and the
<a href="../../../users/generated_files/help_anaddb.html">anaddb_help</a>), or make a walk.</p>
<p>The results of this simulation can be compared to those provided in the
Gianozzi et al paper. The agreement is rather good, despite the low cut-off
energy, and different pseudopotentials.</p>
<p>At X, they get 95cm^-1, 216cm^-1, 337cm^-1 and 393cm^-1, while we get
92.5cm^-1, 204.6cm^-1, 313.9cm^-1 and 375.9cm^-1. With <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#ecut">ecut</a>=6 hartree, we
get 89.7cm^-1, 212.3cm^-1, 328.5cm^-1 and 385.8cm^-1.</p>
<p>At L, they get 71cm^-1, 212cm^-1, 352cm^-1 and 372cm^-1, while we get
69.0cm^-1, 202.5cm^-1, 332.6cm^-1 and 352.3cm^-1. With <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#ecut">ecut</a>=6 hartree, we
get 68.1cm^-1, 208.5cm^-1, 346.7cm^-1 and 362.6cm^-1.</p>
<p>At q=(0.1 0 0), we get 31.6cm^-1, 63.6cm^-1, 342.0cm^-1 and 379.7cm^-1. The
acoustic modes tends (nearly-)linearly to zero, while the optic modes are
close to their values at Gamma : 344.3 cm^-1 and 379.6 cm^-1.</p>
