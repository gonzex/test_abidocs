Choice of solver for the Impurity model.

  * 0=&gt; No solver and U=0, J=0 (see [[upawu]] and [[jpawu]]). 
  * 1=&gt; LDA+U self-energy is used (for testing purpose) 
  * 2=&gt; Hubbard one solver. The Hubbard one solver is an approximation which gives a rough description of correlated Mott insulators. It should not be used for metals. 
  * 5=&gt; Use the Continuous Time Quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) solver CT-Hyb of ABINIT in the density density representation, CTQMC calculations are much more time consuming that Hubbard I calculations. Nevertheless, the calculation is fully parallelised. 
  * 6=&gt; Continuous Time Quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) solver CT-Hyb of TRIQS in the density density representation. 
  * 7=&gt; Continuous Time Quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) solver CT-Hyb of TRIQS with the rotationally invariant formulation. 

  
The CT Hyb algorithm is described in [ Phys. Rev. Lett 97, 076405, (2006)
](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.076405). For a
discussion of density-density approximation with respect with the
rotationnally invariant formulation, see e.g. [ Phys. Rev. B 86, 155107 (2012)
](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.86.155107).  
The ABINIT/CT Hyb implementation is discussed in [
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2016.04.003
](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2016.04.003).  
The TRIQS/CT Hyb implementation is described in [ Comp. Phys. Comm. 200, 274
(2016) ](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2015.10.023). Before using it, it has
to be installed following instructions at
https://triqs.ipht.cnrs.fr/1.3/applications/cthyb/install.html. The current
interface is valid for TRIQS 1.3 and TRIQS/CTHYB 1.3.

## **dmft_tolfreq** 


*Mnemonics:* Dynamical Mean Fied Theory: TOLerance on DFT correlated electron occupation matrix for the definition of the FREQuency grid  
*Characteristics:* [[DEVELOP]]  
*Mentioned in topic(s):* [[topic:DMFT]]  
*Variable type:* real  
*Dimensions:* scalar  
*Default value:* 0.0001  

??? note "Test list (click to open) (Rarely used, [2/920] in all abinit tests, [0/116] in abinit tutorials.)"
    - paral:  [[tests/paral/Input/t99.in|t99.in]]
    - v8:  [[tests/v8/Input/t01.in|t01.in]]






  
The LDA occupation matrix for correlated electrons can be computed directly.
It can be compared to the calculation of the same quantity using LDA Green's
function, a sum over Matsubara frequencies and a projection over correlated
orbitals. Because the Matsubara grid is finite, the two quantities differ. If
this difference is larger than dmft_tolfreq, then the code stops and an error
message is given.

*Characteristics:* [[DEVELOP]]  
*Mentioned in topic(s):* [[topic:DMFT]]  
*Variable type:* real  
*Dimensions:* scalar  
*Default value:* 1e-05

    - v6:  [[tests/v6/Input/t45.in|t45.in]]






  
Tolerance for the variation of Local Charge during iterations of the DMFT
Loop.  
The default value is good for fast calculations. However, to obtain good
convergence of the DFT Loop, the DMFT Loop needs a better convergence
criterion.
