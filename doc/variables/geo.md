## **brvltt** 


*Mnemonics:* BRaVais LaTTice type  
*Mentioned in topic(s):* [[topic:UnitCell]], [[topic:SmartSymm]]  
*Variable type:* integer  
*Dimensions:* scalar  
*Default value:* 0  
*Only relevant if:* [[spgroup]] != 0  

??? note "Test list (click to open). Moderately used, [29/920] in all abinit tests, [0/116] in abinit tutorials"

Set the type of Bravais lattice. The cell defined by [[acell]] and [[rprim]]
or [[angdeg]] should be the CONVENTIONAL cell.

If brvltt=0, the code will assign brvltt from the space group information
[[spgroup]], and produce the symmetry operations for the conventional unit
cell. If the conventional cell is not primitive, the user should set
[[chkprim]]=0.

If brvltt=-1, the code will assign brvltt from the space group information,
then reduce the unit cell to a primitive unit cell. The echo of [[acell]] and
[[rprim]] might thus differ from those derived directly from the input
variables. Also, the input variable [[xred]] will refer to the CONVENTIONAL
unit cell, but its echo will refer to the preprocessed PRIMITIVE unit cell.
There is of course no problem with [[xangst]] and [[xcart]], as they are
independent of the unit cell.

The echo of [[brvltt]] in the output file will be one of the following Bravais
lattices:  

  * 1 = Primitive with no associated translations 
  * 2 = Inner centered with (a/2 + b/2 + c/2) associated translation 
  * 3 = Face centered with (a/2 + b/2; b/2 + c/2; c/2 + a/2) associated translations 
  * 4 = C - centered with (a/2 + b/2) associated translation 
  * 5 = A - centered with (b/2 + c/2) associated translation 
  * 6 = B - centered with (c/2 + a/2) associated translation 
  * 7 = Rhombohedral lattice. 

The user might also input directly these values, although they might not be
consistent with [[spgroup]].

The space groups 146, 148, 155, 160, 161, 166, 167, when used with
[[spgaxor]]=1 (hexagonal axes) will have [[brvltt]]=7 and two associated
translations: (2/3, 1/3, 1/3) and (1/3, 2/3, 2/3).  
For more details see the space group [ help file
](../../users/spacegrouphelpfile.html) .

## **chempot** 


*Mnemonics:* spatially varying CHEMical POTential  
*Mentioned in topic(s):* [[topic:Artificial]]  
*Variable type:* real  
*Dimensions:* (3,[[nzchempot]],[[ntypat]])  
*Default value:* 0.0  
*Only relevant if:* [[nzchempot]]/=0  

??? note "Test list (click to open). Rarely used, [2/920] in all abinit tests, [0/116] in abinit tutorials"
    - v8:  [[tests/v8/Input/t30.in|t30.in]], [[tests/v8/Input/t31.in|t31.in]]






For each type of atoms, from 1 to [[ntypat]], specifies the spatially varying
chemical potential, through the specification of [[nzchempot]] triplets of
real numbers. They give data for [[nzchempot]] delimiting planes, all parallel
to each other, each determined by its z reduced coordinate. The first real
number is the z reduced coordinate of the delimiting plane. The second real
number is the value of the chemical potential for this type of atom on this
plane. The third real number is the derivative of the chemical potential fior
this type of atom with respect to the z reduced coordinate, evaluated on this
plane. In the space between delimiting planes, a piecewise cubic polynomial
interpolation is determined : the cubic polynomial between two delimiting
planes will have the imposed chemical potentials and derivatives on the two
delimiting planes. The z reduced coordinates must be ordered in increasing
values, and cannot span more than 1.0 . There is an automatic periodic
boundary condition imposed. Specifying two identical z reduced coordinates is
allowed, and means that the first one applies to the adjacent space with lower
values of z, while the second applies to the adjacent space with higher values
of z. When the spatial chemical potential is defined only for one type of atom
(and no chemical potential is present for the other atoms), simply set the
related values to *0.0 in the [[chempot]] array. In the present input array,
reduced positions, energies and derivatives of energies are mixed. Hence,
although the chemical potential is an energy, one cannot use the usual energy
definitions (i.e. the chemical potential is always to be input in Hartree
atomic units).

## **genafm** 


*Mnemonics:* GENerator of the translation for Anti-FerroMagnetic space group  
*Mentioned in topic(s):* [[topic:spinpolarisation]], [[topic:SmartSymm]]  
*Variable type:* real  
*Dimensions:* (3)  
*Default value:* 3*0  

??? note "Test list (click to open). Rarely used, [1/920] in all abinit tests, [0/116] in abinit tutorials"
    - v3:  [[tests/v3/Input/t22.in|t22.in]]






This input variable might be used to define a Shubnikov type IV magnetic space
group (anti-ferromagnetic space group). The user is advised to consult "The
mathematical theory of symmetry in solids, Representation theory for point
groups and space groups, 1972, C.J. Bradley and A.P. Cracknell, Clarendon
Press, Oxford."  
A Shubnikov type IV magnetic space group might be defined by its Fedorov space
group (set of spatial symmetries, that do not change the magnetization), and
one translation associated with a change of magnetization. [[genafm]] is
precisely this translation, in reduced coordinates (like [[xred]])  
Thus, one way to specify a Shubnikov IV magnetic space group, is to define
both [[spgroup]] and [[genafm]]. Alternatively, one might define [[spgroup]]
and [[spgroupma]], or define by hand the set of symmetries, using [[symrel]],
[[tnons]] and [[symafm]]

## **natrd**

    - v6:  [[tests/v6/Input/t30.in|t30.in]] ...






Gives the number of atoms to be read from the input file, in the case the atom
manipulator or the smart symmetriser is used. In this case, [[natrd]] is also
used to dimension the array [[typat]], and the arrays [[xred]], [[xangst]] and
[[xcart]].  
Must take into account the vacancies (see [[vacnum]] and [[vaclst]]).  
Despite possible vacancies, cannot be bigger than [[natom]].

## **nobj** 


*Mnemonics:* Number of OBJects  
*Characteristics:* [[INPUT_ONLY]]  
*Mentioned in topic(s):* [[topic:AtomManipulator]]  
*Variable type:* integer  
*Dimensions:* scalar  
*Default value:* 0  

??? note "Test list (click to open). Rarely used, [3/920] in all abinit tests, [0/116] in abinit tutorials"
    - v1:  [[tests/v1/Input/t40.in|t40.in]], [[tests/v1/Input/t42.in|t42.in]], [[tests/v1/Input/t43.in|t43.in]]






Gives the number of 'objects' to be used by the atom manipulator in order to
find the full set of atoms. At present, only one or two objects can be
defined, identified as objects 'a' and 'b'.  
Related variables for object 'a' are : [[objan]], [[objaat]], [[objarf]],
[[objatr]], [[objaro]], [[objaax]]. Related variables for object 'b' are :
[[objbn]] , [[objbat]] , [[objbrf]] , [[objbtr]] , [[objbro]] , [[objbax]] .  

More detailed explanation : when the atom manipulator is used (i.e. when
[[nobj]]==1 or [[nobj]]==2), the code will be given a primitive set of atoms,
from which it will have to deduce the full set of atoms.  
An object will be specified by the number of atoms it includes ([[objan]] or
[[objbn]] ), and the list of these atoms ([[objaat]] or [[objbat]] ).  
Examples of physical realisation of an object can be a molecule, or a group of
atom to be repeated, or a part of a molecule to be rotated. The atom
amnipulator can indeed repeat these objects ([[objarf]] or [[objbrf]] ),
rotate them ([[objaro]] or [[objbro]] ) with respect to an axis ([[objaax]] or
[[objbax]] ), and translate them ([[objatr]] or [[objbtr]] ). After having
generated a geometry thanks to rotation, translation and repetition of
objects, it is possible to remove some atoms, in order to create vacancies
([[vacnum]] and [[vaclst]]). The number of atoms in the primitive set, those
that will be read from the input file, is specified by the variable [[natrd]].
It will be always smaller than the final number of atoms, given by the
variable [[natom]]. The code checks whether the primitive number of atoms plus
those obtained by the repetition operation is coherent with the variable
[[natom]], taking into account possible vacancies.  
You should look at the other variables for more information. Go to [[objan]],
for example.  

## **nzchempot** 


*Mnemonics:* Number of Z reduced coordinates that define the spatial CHEMical POTential  
*Mentioned in topic(s):* [[topic:Artificial]]  
*Variable type:* integer  
*Dimensions:* scalar  
*Default value:* None  

??? note "Test list (click to open). Rarely used, [2/920] in all abinit tests, [0/116] in abinit tutorials"
    - v8:  [[tests/v8/Input/t30.in|t30.in]], [[tests/v8/Input/t31.in|t31.in]]






Defines the number of z reduced coordinates that defines the spatially varying
chemical potential. See the input variable [[chempot]], of which [[nzchempot]]
is the second dimension.

## **objaat** 


*Mnemonics:* OBJect A : list of AToms  
*Characteristics:* [[INPUT_ONLY]]  
*Mentioned in topic(s):* [[topic:AtomManipulator]]  
*Variable type:* integer  
*Dimensions:* ([[objan]])  
*Default value:* None  
*Only relevant if:* '[[nobj]]==1'
  

??? note "Test list (click to open). Rarely used, [3/920] in all abinit tests, [0/116] in abinit tutorials"
    - v1:  [[tests/v1/Input/t40.in|t40.in]], [[tests/v1/Input/t42.in|t42.in]], [[tests/v1/Input/t43.in|t43.in]]






Gives the list of atoms in object a. This list is specified by giving, for
each atom, its index in the list of coordinates ([[xred]], [[xangst]] or
[[xcart]]), that also corresponds to a type of atom (given by the array type).
These objects can be thought as molecules, or groups of atoms, or parts of
molecules, to be repeated, rotated and translated to generate the full set of
atoms.  
Look at [[objarf]] for further explanations.  

## **objaax** 


*Mnemonics:* OBJect A : AXis  
*Characteristics:* [[INPUT_ONLY]], [[LENGTH]]  
*Mentioned in topic(s):* [[topic:AtomManipulator]]  
*Variable type:* real  
*Dimensions:* (6)  
*Default value:* None  
*Comment:* [[objaax]] must be provided if ([[nobj]]==1 and one component of [[objaro]] != 0). Moreover,
[[objaax]] AND [[objbax]] must be provided if ( [[nobj]] == 2 and one component of [[objbro]] != 0 ).  

??? note "Test list (click to open). Rarely used, [2/920] in all abinit tests, [0/116] in abinit tutorials"
    - v1:  [[tests/v1/Input/t42.in|t42.in]], [[tests/v1/Input/t43.in|t43.in]]






Gives, for each object, the cartesian coordinates of two points (first point :
[[objaax]](1:3) second point : [[objaax]](4:6). By default, given in Bohr
atomic units (1 Bohr=0.5291772108 Angstroms), although Angstrom can be
specified, if preferred, since these variables have the '[[LENGTH]]'
characteristics.  
The two points define an axis of rotation of the corresponding object.  
Note that the rotation of the object is done BEFORE the object is translated.  
The sign of the rotation angle is positive if the object is to be rotated
clockwise when looking to it along the axis, from point 1 (coordinates 1:3)
toward point 2 (coordinates 4:6).  

## **objan** 


*Mnemonics:* OBJect A : Number of atoms  
*Characteristics:* [[INPUT_ONLY]]  
*Mentioned in topic(s):* [[topic:AtomManipulator]]  
*Variable type:* integer  
*Dimensions:* scalar  
*Default value:* None  
*Comment:*  [[objan]] MUST be provided if [[nobj]]==1.
 [[objan]] and [[objbn]] MUST be provided if [[nobj]]==2.  

??? note "Test list (click to open). Rarely used, [3/920] in all abinit tests, [0/116] in abinit tutorials"
    - v1:  [[tests/v1/Input/t40.in|t40.in]], [[tests/v1/Input/t42.in|t42.in]], [[tests/v1/Input/t43.in|t43.in]]






Gives the number of atoms in object a. The list of atoms is given by the
variables [[objaat]].  

## **objarf** 


*Mnemonics:* OBJect A : Repetition Factors  
*Characteristics:* [[INPUT_ONLY]]  
*Mentioned in topic(s):* [[topic:AtomManipulator]]  
*Variable type:* integer  
*Dimensions:* (3)  
*Default value:* [1, 1, 1]  

??? note "Test list (click to open). Rarely used, [3/920] in all abinit tests, [0/116] in abinit tutorials"
    - v1:  [[tests/v1/Input/t40.in|t40.in]], [[tests/v1/Input/t42.in|t42.in]], [[tests/v1/Input/t43.in|t43.in]]






Gives three repetition factors of the objects a.  
This gives the opportunity to generate a three-dimensional set of repeated
objects, although a simple one-dimensional repetition will be easily obtained
through the specification of  
'nrep' 1 1  
where 'nrep' is the 1D repetition factor.  
The initial rotation and translation of the object, as well as the increment
of rotation or translation from one object to the next are specified by the
variables [[objaro]] and [[objatr]], for object a,  
Note that the atom manipulator will generate the full set of atoms from the
primitive set of atoms using the following order : it will process each atom
in the primitive list one by one, determine whether it belongs to either
object a or object b, and then repeat it taking into account the proper
rotation and translation, with the fastest varying repetition factor being the
first, then the second, then the third.  
In the final list of atoms, one will first find the atoms generated from atom
1 in the primitive list, then those generated from atom 2 in the primitive
list, and so on.  
If the atom manipulator is only used to rotate or translate an object, without
repeating it, simply use 1 1 1, which is also the Default value.  

## **objaro** 


*Mnemonics:* OBJect A : ROtations  
*Characteristics:* [[INPUT_ONLY]]  
*Mentioned in topic(s):* [[topic:AtomManipulator]]  
*Variable type:* real  
*Dimensions:* (4)  
*Default value:* 4*0.0d0  
*Comment:* (no rotation)  

??? note "Test list (click to open). Rarely used, [2/920] in all abinit tests, [0/116] in abinit tutorials"
    - v1:  [[tests/v1/Input/t42.in|t42.in]], [[tests/v1/Input/t43.in|t43.in]]






Give, for each object, the angles of rotation in degrees to be applied to the
corresponding object.  
The rotation is applied before the translation, and the axis is defined by the
variables [[objaax]] and [[objbax]]. See the latter variables for the
definition of the sign of the rotation.  
The first component [[objaro]](1) and ** objbro ** (1) gives the angle of
rotation to be applied to the first instance of the object. The second, third
or fourth component (resp.) gives the increment of rotation angle from one
instance to the next instance, defined by the first, second or third
repetition factor (resp.) . This allows to generate 3D arrays of molecules
with different rotation angles.  

## **objatr** 


*Mnemonics:* OBJect A : TRanslations  
*Characteristics:* [[INPUT_ONLY]], [[LENGTH]]  
*Mentioned in topic(s):* [[topic:AtomManipulator]]  
*Variable type:* real  
*Dimensions:* (12)  
*Default value:* 12*0.0d0  
*Comment:* (no translation)  

??? note "Test list (click to open). Rarely used, [3/920] in all abinit tests, [0/116] in abinit tutorials"
    - v1:  [[tests/v1/Input/t40.in|t40.in]], [[tests/v1/Input/t42.in|t42.in]], [[tests/v1/Input/t43.in|t43.in]]






Give, for each object, the vectors of translations, in cartesian coordinates,
to be applied to the corresponding object. By default, given in Bohr atomic
units (1 Bohr=0.5291772108 Angstroms), although Angstrom can be specified, if
preferred, since these variables have the '[[LENGTH]]' characteristics.  
The translation is applied after the rotation.  
The first vector [[objatr]](3,1) and [[objbtr]](3,1) gives the translation to
be applied to the first instance of the object. The second, third or fourth
component (resp.) gives the increment of translation from one instance to the
next instance, defined by the first, second or third repetition factor (resp.)
. This allows to generate 3D arrays of molecules.  
In general, when the objects are repeated, a translation vector must be given,
since otherwise, the repeated objects pack in the same region of space. As an
exception, one can have a set of molecules regularly spaced on a circle, in
which case, only rotations are needed.  
Not present in the dtset array (no internal).

## **objbat** 


*Mnemonics:* OBJect B : list of AToms  
*Characteristics:* [[INPUT_ONLY]]  
*Mentioned in topic(s):* [[topic:AtomManipulator]]  
*Variable type:* integer

*Default value:* None  
*Only relevant if:* [[nobj]]==2

    - v1:  [[tests/v1/Input/t42.in|t42.in]], [[tests/v1/Input/t43.in|t43.in]]






Gives the list of atoms in object b. This list is specified by giving, for
each atom, its index in the list of coordinates ([[xred]], [[xangst]] or
[[xcart]]), that also corresponds to a type of atom (given by the array type).
These objects can be thought as molecules, or groups of atoms, or parts of
molecules, to be repeated, rotated and translated to generate the full set of
atoms.  
Look at [[objbrf]] for further explanations.  

## **objbax**

    - v1:  [[tests/v1/Input/t43.in|t43.in]]






Gives, for each object, the cartesian coordinates of two points (first point :
[[objbax]](1:3) second point : [[objbax]](4:6). By default, given in Bohr
atomic units (1 Bohr=0.5291772108 Angstroms), although Angstrom can be
specified, if preferred, since these variables have the '[[LENGTH]]'
characteristics.  
The two points define an axis of rotation of the corresponding object.  
Note that the rotation of the object is done BEFORE the object is translated.  
The sign of the rotation angle is positive if the object is to be rotated
clockwise when looking to it along the axis, from point 1 (coordinates 1:3)
toward point 2 (coordinates 4:6).

    - v1:  [[tests/v1/Input/t42.in|t42.in]], [[tests/v1/Input/t43.in|t43.in]]






Gives three repetition factors of the objects a or b.  
This gives the opportunity to generate a three-dimensional set of repeated
objects, although a simple one-dimensional repetition will be easily obtained
through the specification of  
nrep 1 1 &lt;r&gt; where nrep is the 1D repetition factor.  
The initial rotation and translation of the object, as well as the increment
of rotation or translation from one object to the next are specified by the
variables [[objbro]] and [[objbtr]], for object b.  
Note that the atom manipulator will generate the full set of atoms from the
primitive set of atoms using the following order : it will process each atom
in the primitive list one by one, determine whether it belongs to either
object a or object b, and then repeat it taking into account the proper
rotation and translation, with the fastest varying repetition factor being the
first, then the second, then the third.  
In the final list of atoms, one will first find the atoms generated from atom
1 in the primitive list, then those generated from atom 2 in the primitive
list, and so on.  
If the atom manipulator is only used to rotate or translate an object, without
repeating it, simply use 1 1 1, which is also the Default value.

    - v1:  [[tests/v1/Input/t43.in|t43.in]]






Give, for each object, the angles of rotation in degrees to be applied to the
corresponding object.  
The rotation is applied before the translation, and the axis is defined by the
variables [[objaax]] and [[objbax]]. See the latter variables for the
definition of the sign of the rotation.  
The first component [[objaro]](1) and ** objbro ** (1) gives the angle of
rotation to be applied to the first instance of the object. The second, third
or fourth component (resp.) gives the increment of rotation angle from one
instance to the next instance, defined by the first, second or third
repetition factor (resp.) . This allows to generate 3D arrays of molecules
with different rotation angles.

    - v1:  [[tests/v1/Input/t42.in|t42.in]], [[tests/v1/Input/t43.in|t43.in]]

The first vector [[objatr]](3,1) and [[objbtr]](3,1) gives the translation to
be applied to the first instance of the object. The second, third or fourth
component (resp.) gives the increment of translation from one instance to the
next instance, defined by the first, second or third repetition factor (resp.)
. This allows to generate 3D arrays of molecules.  
In general, when the objects are repeated, a translation vector must be given,
since otherwise, the repeated objects pack in the same region of space. As an
exception, one can have a set of molecules regularly spaced on a circle, in
which case, only rotations are needed.

This internal variable characterizes a Shubnikov type III magnetic space group
(anti-ferromagnetic space group). The user is advised to consult "The
mathematical theory of symmetry in solids, Representation theory for point
groups and space groups, 1972, C.J. Bradley and A.P. Cracknell, Clarendon
Press, Oxford."  
A Shubnikov type III magnetic space group might be defined by its Fedorov
space group (set of all spatial symmetries, irrespective of their magnetic
action), and the halving space group (only the symmetries that do not change
the magnetization).  
The specification of the halving space group might be done by specifying, for
each point symmetry, the magnetic action. See Table 7.1 of the above-mentioned
reference. Magnetic point groups are numbered from 1 to 58.

It is taken into account only when [[spgroup]]/=0; it allows one to define the
axes orientation for the specific space groups for which this is needed.
Trigonal groups (number 146,148,155,160,161,166,167):

  * 1 represents the hexagonal axes 
  * 2 represents the rhombohedral axes 

Orthorhombic space groups : there are six possibilities corresponding to the
possible axes permutations

  * 1 abc -&gt; abc 
  * 2 abc -&gt; cab 
  * 3 abc -&gt; bca 
  * 4 abc -&gt; acb 
  * 5 abc -&gt; bac 
  * 6 abc -&gt; cba 

Monoclinic : there are 3 or 9 possibilities depending on the space group. See
the space group [ help file ](../../users/spacegrouphelpfile.html) for
details. In the log/output file the notation used to describe the monoclinic
groups is for example:  
15:c1, A2/a_c = C2/c  
where,

  * 15 represents the space group number, 
  * c1 the orientation as it appears on the web page, 
  * A is the real Bravais type lattice, 
  * 2/a the existent symmetry elements, 
  * _c marks the orientation of the two-fold axis or of the mirror plane, 
  * C2/c represents the parent space group. 

How to determine which spgaxor you need:

  1. check the reduced positions you have, for more symmetric positions, e.g. 1/2 1/4 3/4 etc... Let us say your symmetric positions are in the first coordinate (a axis) and you are using spgroup 62. 
  2. look up the raw space group Wyckoff positions on [ the Bilbao server ](http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cgi-bin/cryst/programs/nph-wp-list) to see where they put the corresponding symmetric positions. For spgroup 62 Bilbao puts the 1/4 3/4 in the second coordinate, ie along the b axis. 
  3. in this case you need to swap the axes from the original abc order to a new order where the Bilbao axis (b) is in the first position. In this case you have 2 possibilities, spgaxor 3 or 5. If you have more than one highly symmetric coordinate you may have only a single possibility.

Gives the number of the space group.  
If [[spgroup]] is 0, the code assumes that all the symmetries are input
through the [[symrel]] matrices and the [[tnons]] vectors, or obtained from
the symmetry finder (the default when [[nsym]]==0).  
It should be between 1 and 230. This option can be used to obtain all the
atoms in the unit cell, starting from the asymmetric unit cell.  
The references for computing the symmetry corresponding to the space groups
are :

  * International Tables for Crystallography, 1983, Ed. Theo Hahn, D. Reidel Publishing Company 
  * The mathematical theory of symmetry in solids, Representation theory for point groups and space groups, 1972, C.J. Bradley and A.P. Cracknell, Clarendon Press, Oxford.

This input variable might be used to define a Shubnikov magnetic space group
(anti-ferromagnetic space group). The user is advised to consult "The
mathematical theory of symmetry in solids, Representation theory for point
groups and space groups, 1972, C.J. Bradley and A.P. Cracknell, Clarendon
Press, Oxford."  
A Shubnikov type IV magnetic space group might be defined by its Fedorov space
group (set of spatial symmetries that do not change the magnetization), and an
additional magnetic space group number [[spgroupma]].  
A Shubnikov type III magnetic space group might be defined by its Fedorov
space group (set of all spatial symmetries, irrespective of their magnetic
action), and an additional magnetic space group number [[spgroupma]].  
For the additional number [[spgroupma]], we follow the definition of Table 7.4
of the above-mentioned Bradley and Cracknell textbook.  
Thus, one way to specify a Shubnikov IV magnetic space group, is to define
both [[spgroup]] and [[spgroupma]].  
For example, the group P2_1/c_prime has [[spgroup]]=14 and [[spgroupma]]=78.  
Alternatively, for Shubnikov IV magnetic groups, one might define [[spgroup]]
and [[genafm]]. For both the type III and IV, one might define by hand the set
of symmetries, using [[symrel]], [[tnons]] and [[symafm]].

Gives the tolerance on the atomic positions (reduced coordinates), primitive
vectors, or magnetization, to be considered equivalent, thanks to symmetry
operations. This is used in the recognition of the set of symmetries of the
system, or the application of the symmetry operations to generate from a
reduced set of atoms, the full set of atoms. Note that a value larger than
0.01 is considered to be unacceptable.  
Note : ABINIT needs the atomic positions to be symmmetric to each others
within 1.e-8 . If [[tolsym]] is set to a larger value than 1.e-8, then the
input atomic coordinates will be automatically symmetrized by the symmetry
operations that will have been found.

a comment line, then one line per atom, with the element as a 2 letter symbol
("As" "O" or "Pu") and the three cartesian coordinates in Angstrom.
