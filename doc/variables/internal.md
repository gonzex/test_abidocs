internal variable gives the number of Fast Fourier Transform points in the
(double) grid generated by [[ngfftdg]](1:3). It is simply the product of the

If space parallelisation is used (that is, if [[paral_kgb]]==1), then it

## **npweps** 


*Mnemonics:* Number of PlaneWaves for EPSilon (the dielectric matrix)

independent-particle susceptibility $\chi^{(0)}_{KS}$, the dielectric matrix
$\epsilon$ and its inverse.

generate the exchange part of the self-energy operator.  
It is an internal variable, determed from [[ecutsigx]].

## **npwwfn** 


*Mnemonics:* Number of PlaneWaves for WaveFunctioNs  
*Characteristics:* [[INTERNAL_ONLY]]  
*Mentioned in topic(s):* [[topic:Susceptibility]], [[topic:SelfEnergy]]

*Default value:* None  

??? note "Test list (click to open) (Rarely used, [0/920] in all abinit tests, [0/116] in abinit tutorials.)"






[[npwwfn]] is the size of the planewave set used to represent the
wavefunctions in the formula that generates the independent-particle
susceptibility $\chi^{(0)}_{KS}$. It is an internal variable, determined from

## **qptn** 


*Mnemonics:* Q-PoinT re-Normalized  
*Characteristics:* [[INTERNAL_ONLY]]  
*Mentioned in topic(s):* [[topic:DFPT]]  
*Variable type:* real  
*Dimensions:* (3)  
*Default value:* 3*0  
*Only relevant if:* [[nqpt]]==1  

??? note "Test list (click to open) (Rarely used, [2/920] in all abinit tests, [0/116] in abinit tutorials.)"
    - v3:  [[tests/v3/Input/t85.in|t85.in]], [[tests/v3/Input/t86.in|t86.in]]






Only used if [[nqpt]]=1.  
In ground-state calculation, the vector [[qptn]](1:3) is added to each
renormalized k point (whatever the value of [[kptopt]] that was used) to
generate the normalized, shifted, set of k-points [[kptns]](1:3,1: ** nkpt **
).  
In response-function calculations, [[qptn]](1:3) is the wavevector of the
phonon-type calculation.  
[[qptn]](1:3) can be produced on the basis of the different methods described
in [[qptopt]], like using [[qpt]](1:3) with renormalisation provided by
[[qptnrm]], or using the other possibilities defined by [[iqpt]], [[ngqpt]],
[[nshiftq]], [[qptrlatt]], [[shiftq]],  
For insulators, there is no restriction on the q-points to be used for the
perturbations. By contrast, for metals, for the time being, it is advised to
take q points for which the k and k+q grids are the same (when the periodicity
in reciprocal space is taken into account). Tests remain to be done to see
whether other q points might be allowed (perhaps with some modification of the
code).
