## **bs_algorithm** 


*Mnemonics:* Bethe-Salpeter ALGORITHM  
*Mentioned in topic(s):* [[topic:BSE]]  
*Variable type:* integer  
*Dimensions:* scalar  
*Default value:* 2  
*Only relevant if:* [[optdriver]] == 99

The bs_algorithm input variable defines the algorithm employed to calculate
the macroscopic dielectric function. Possible values are 1, 2 or 3:

  * 1 =&gt; The macroscopic dielectric is obtained by performing a direct diagonalization of the excitonic Hamiltonian. Advantages: It gives direct access to the excitonic eigenvalues as well as to the oscillator strengths. Drawbacks: It is a very CPU- and memory-consuming approach as the size of the Hamiltonian scales as (nk*nc*nv)**2. where nk is the number of k-point in the FULL Brillouin zone, and nc and nv are the number of conduction and valence states, respectively. Pros: It can be used both for resonant-only and resonant+coupling calculations (non Tamm-Dancoff approximation). 
  * 2 =&gt; Haydock iterative method. The macroscopic dielectric function is obtained by iterative applications of the Hamiltonian on a set of vectors in the electron-hole space. Advantages: It is less memory demanding and usually faster than the direct diagonalization provided that [[zcut]] is larger than the typical energy spacing of the eigenvalues. Drawbacks: It is an iterative method therefore the convergence with respect to bs_haydock_niter should be checked. It is not possible to have direct information on the exciton spectrum, oscillator strengths and excitonic wave functions. For the time being [[bs_algorithm]]=2 cannot be used for calculations in which the coupling term is included (Tamm-Dancoff approximation). 
  * 3 =&gt; Conjugate-gradient method. This method allows to find the few first excitonic eigenvalues. Only available for resonant calculations (Tamm-Dancoff approximation).

  * 2 =&gt; The transition space is constructed with Kohn-Sham orbitals but the energies are read from the external GW file 
  * 3 =&gt; QP amplitudes and energies will be read from the QPS file and used to construct H_ex. Not coded yet because &lt;\psi|r|\psj&gt;^QP should be calculated taking into account the non-locality of the self-energy in the commutator [H,r].

This variable governs the choice among the different options that are
available for the treatment of Coulomb term of the Bethe-Salpeter Hamiltonian.
[[bs_coulomb_term]] is the concatenation of two digits, labelled (A) and (B).

The first digit (A) can assume the values 0,1,2:

  * 0 =&gt; The Coulomb term is not computed. This choice is equivalent to computing the RPA spectrum but using the representation in transition space instead of the more efficient approach based on the sum over states. 
  * 1 =&gt; The Coulomb term is computed using the screened interaction read from an external SCR file (standard excitonic calculation). 
  * 2 =&gt; The Coulomb term is computed using a model screening function (useful for convergence studies or for reproducing published results). 

The second digit (B) can assume the values 0,1:

  * 0 =&gt; Use a diagonal approximation for W_GG' (mainly used for accelerating convergence studies). 
  * 1 =&gt; The Coulomb term is correctly evaluated using the truly non-local W(r,r').

The [[bs_coupling]] input variable defines the treatment of the coupling block
of the Bethe-Salpeter Hamiltonian. Possible values are 0,1.

  * 0 =&gt; The coupling block is neglected (the so-called Tamm-Dancoff approximation). The code runs faster and the Hamiltonian matrix requires less memory (factor 4). It is a good approximation for the absorption spectrum which only requires the knowledge of Im(\epsilon). The reliability of this approximation should be tested in the case of EELF calculations.

  * 0 =&gt; No terminator. The contribution given by the terms missing in the Lanczos chain are set to zero. 
  * 1 =&gt; Use the terminator function. The particular expression depends on the type of calculation: In the resonant-only case, the a_i and b_i coefficients for i &gt; niter, are replaced by their values at i=niter. Even the coupling block is included, the terminator function described in D. Rocca, R. Gebauer, Y. Saad, S. Baroni, J. Chem. Phys. 128, 154105 (2008) is used.

Defines the convergence criterion for the Haydock iterative method. The
iterative algorithm stops when the difference between two consecutive
evaluations of the macroscopic dielectric function is less than **
bs_haydock_tol(1) ** . The sign of ** bs_haydock_tol(1) ** defines how to

should be reached for each frequency (strict criterion), while a positive
value indicates that the converge error is estimated by averaging over the
entire frequency range (mild criterion).

**bs_haydock_tol(2)** defines the quantity that will be checked for convergence:
