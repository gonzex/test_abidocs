## **kptns**

Variable type: real  
Dimensions: (3,[[nkpt]])  
Default value: None  



If [[nqpt]]=0, or if one is doing a reponse calculation, this internal
variable is derived from [[kpt]] and [[kptnrm]]: [[kptns]](1:3,:)=
[[kpt]](1:3,:)/ [[kptnrm]], so that it is [[kpt]] renormalized by [[kptnrm]].  
If [[nqpt]]=1 and one is not doing a ground-state calculation, this internal
variable is derived from [[kpt]],[[kptnrm]] and [[qptn]] [[kptns]](1:3,:)=
[[kpt]](1:3,:)/ [[kptnrm]]+ [[qptn]](1:3), so that it is [[kpt]] renormalized

Variable type: integer  
Dimensions: scalar  
Default value: None  



This internal variable gives the number of dynamical images, immediately
deduced from the number of non-zero values present in [[dynimage]]. It is used
to dimension many memory-consuming arrays (one copy for each image), e.g. the
wavefunction array (cg), the density array (rho), etc .




## **nelect**

Variable type: real  
Dimensions: scalar  
Default value: [[AUTO_FROM_PSP]]  



This internal variable gives the number of electrons per unit cell, as
computed from the sum of the valence electrons related to each atom (given in
the pseudopotential, where it is called "zion"), and the input variable
[[charge]]:  
[[nelect]]=zion-[[charge]].




## **nfft** 


 Mnemonics: Number of FFT points  
Variable type: integer  
Dimensions: scalar  
Default value: None  



If space parallelisation is not used (that is, if [[paral_kgb]]==0), this
internal variable gives the number of Fast Fourier Transform points in the
grid generated by [[ngfft]](1:3). It is simply the product of the three
components of [[ngfft]].  
If space parallelisation is used (that is, if [[paral_kgb]]==1), then it
becomes the number of Fast Fourier Transform points attributed to the
particular processor. It is no longer the above-mentioned simple product, but
a number usually close to this product divided by the number of processors on
which the space is shared.




## **nfftdg** 


 Mnemonics: Number of FFT points for the Double Grid  
Variable type: integer  
Dimensions: scalar  
Default value: None  



If space parallelisation is not used (that is, if [[paral_kgb]]==0), this
internal variable gives the number of Fast Fourier Transform points in the
(double) grid generated by [[ngfftdg]](1:3). It is simply the product of the
three components of [[ngfftdg]].  
If space parallelisation is used (that is, if [[paral_kgb]]==1), then it
becomes the number of Fast Fourier Transform points attributed to the
particular processor. It is no longer the above-mentioned simple product, but
a number usually close to this product divided by the number of processors on
which the space is shared.




## **npweps** 


 Mnemonics: Number of PlaneWaves for EPSilon (the dielectric matrix)  
Variable type: integer  
Dimensions: scalar

[[npweps]] determines the size of the planewave set used to represent the
independent-particle susceptibility $\chi^{(0)}_{KS}$, the dielectric matrix
$\epsilon$ and its inverse.  
It is an internal variable, determined from [[ecuteps]].




## **npwsigx** 


 Mnemonics: Number of PlaneWaves for SIGma eXchange  
Variable type: integer

[[npwsigx]] determines the cut-off energy of the planewave set used to
generate the exchange part of the self-energy operator.

 Mnemonics: Number of PlaneWaves for WaveFunctioNs  
Variable type: integer  
Dimensions: scalar  
Default value: None  



[[npwwfn]] is the size of the planewave set used to represent the
wavefunctions in the formula that generates the independent-particle
susceptibility $\chi^{(0)}_{KS}$. It is an internal variable, determined from
[[ecutwfn]].




## **qptn** 


 Mnemonics: Q-PoinT re-Normalized  
Variable type: real  
Dimensions: (3)  
Default value: 3*0  
Only relevant if [[nqpt]]==1  



Only used if [[nqpt]]=1.  
In ground-state calculation, the vector [[qptn]](1:3) is added to each
renormalized k point (whatever the value of [[kptopt]] that was used) to
generate the normalized, shifted, set of k-points [[kptns]](1:3,1: ** nkpt **
).  
In response-function calculations, [[qptn]](1:3) is the wavevector of the
phonon-type calculation.  
[[qptn]](1:3) can be produced on the basis of the different methods described
in [[qptopt]], like using [[qpt]](1:3) with renormalisation provided by
[[qptnrm]], or using the other possibilities defined by [[iqpt]], [[ngqpt]],
[[nshiftq]], [[qptrlatt]], [[shiftq]],  
For insulators, there is no restriction on the q-points to be used for the
perturbations. By contrast, for metals, for the time being, it is advised to
take q points for which the k and k+q grids are the same (when the periodicity
in reciprocal space is taken into account). Tests remain to be done to see
whether other q points might be allowed (perhaps with some modification of the
code).




## **usefock** 


 Mnemonics: USE FOCK exact exchange  
Variable type: integer

(see [ PAW variables ](varpaw.html) ) can only be performed with PAW atomic
data input files, while pseudopotential calculations are performed in ABINIT
with norm-conserving pseudopotential input files. Most functionalities in
ABINIT are available with either type of calculation.
