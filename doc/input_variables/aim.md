## **crit** 


*Mnemonics:* computation of CRITical points  
*Mentioned in topic(s):* [[topic:Bader]]  
*Variable type:* integer  
*Dimensions:* scalar  
*Default value:* 0  

??? note "Test list (click to open) (Rarely used, [5/1136] in all tests, [0/135] in tutorials.)"
    - v3:  [[tests/v3/Input/t57.in]]
    - v4:  [[tests/v4/Input/t31.in]], [[tests/v4/Input/t33.in]], [[tests/v4/Input/t34.in]]
    - v6:  [[tests/v6/Input/t19.in]]






Drives the computation of critical points.

  * [0] not 
  * [-1] reading from the file ``root''.crit 
  * [1] calculated (simplified version) 
  * [2] calculated (standard version - recommended) 
  * [3] calculated (the original version) 

The original version searches all critical points (CPs) starting from the
center between two and three atoms (atom - neighbor(s)) by Newton-Raphson
algorithm - without tests (not recommended) - don't use together with surface
analysis !

The simplified and standard versions search CP(3,-1) starting from the center
of the pairs~atom-neighbor; then CP(3,1) from the center between two CP(3,-1)
and finally CP(3,3) from the center between two CP(3,1). The robust
Popeliers's algorithm is used. The difference between the two is based in the
fact that the standard version makes the test if the CP is really on the Bader
surface of the calculated atom for each CP, while the simplified version does
this only for CP(3,-1). When CP analysis is rather fast (with respect to
surface determination), 2 is recommended. In all cases the number of neighbors
considered is limited by distance cutoff (variable [[maxatd@aim]])

??? note "Test list (click to open) (Rarely used, [1/1136] in all tests, [0/135] in tutorials.)"
    - v4:  [[tests/v4/Input/t33.in]]






If two "numerically different" critical points are separated by less than
**dpclim**, they are considered to be the same critical point. This often
happens because of numerical inaccuracies : one CP might be "seen" by two
different finite elements. The default should be OK when the ecut is quite
large, on the order of 60 Hartree. For less accurate calculations of the
density, increase the default value to 5.d-2, let's say.

The search for one particular CP is decided to be successful when either the
norm of the gradient of the electron density is smaller than **lgrad** or when
the length of the planned search step is smaller than [[aim:lstep]]. If the
number of search step becomes larger than an internal limit (presently set to
100), one will allow a weaker criteria for satisfaction, based on
[[aim:lgrad2]] and [[aim:lstep2]]. If the internal limit is reached, and the
criteria on [[aim:lgrad2]] and [[aim:lstep2]] are not satisfied, then the
searching procedure continues with the next seed.

The first estimation of the smallest radius of the basin of the atom (the
distance at which the procedure that follows the gradient path announces that
the gradient path finishes in the corresponding atom) This parameter is very
important for the speed of the calculation, but this first estimation is not
usually used because the program makes a new one based on the knowledge of
CPs. In fact after the CP analysis, the new estimation is done by the product
of the ad hoc parameter [[aim:coff1]] (default 0.98) by the distance of the
nearest bonding CP. If there is a problem later, [[aim:coff2]] (default 0.95)
is used instead.

Angular limits of integration of the Bader volume for the theta variables. The
number of integration points is given by [[aim:ntheta]]. The range of
integration can be decreased if there are symmetry reasons for doing this.
