differs from [0, 0, 0], the code will use the Fourier transform to interpolate
the DFPT potentials on this fine q-mesh starting from the irreducible set of
q-points read from the DDB file. This approach is similar to the one used to
interpolate the interatomic force constants in q-space. If eph_ngqpt_fine is

DDB file (default behavior).
