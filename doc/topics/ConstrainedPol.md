Compute polarization in cartesian coordinates, and update lattice constants
and atomic positions in order to perform a structural optimization at
constrained polarization, following the formalism described in Na Sai et al,
PRB 66, 104108 (2002). More details in [[anaddb:polflag]]. The geometry
optimization is done in ANADDB.
