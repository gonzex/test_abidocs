The charge density of states close to the Fermi energy can be output, and
provide a simple approach to STM image calculations (not for PAW). See input
variable [[prtstm]] and [[stmbias]] for explanations. The example input file
will also be useful. The angular momentum decomposed DOS can be evaluated in a
sphere around any point, and provide STS analysis.
