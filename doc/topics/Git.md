## Introduction

ABINIT is developed under the control of [[https://git-scm.com/|git]], a well-
known Version Control System. There is an official
[[https://github.com/abinit/abinit|github mirror]] of the Abinit repository.
We welcome bug fixes and improvements. Note that most of the active
developments are hosted on the [[https://gitlab.abinit.org/|Gitlab server]].
Before embarking on making significant changes, please contact the Abinit
group.

See [[https://github.com/abinit|the many different projects linked to ABINIT
on Github]], actually gathered in the Github ABINIT organization.
