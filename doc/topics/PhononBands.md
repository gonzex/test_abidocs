The Fourier transformation of the phonon dynamical matrices generates
interatomic force constants in real space, as explained in [[Gonze1997a]].
Backtransforming to reciprocal space gives the Fourier interpolation of the
initial phonon band structure. After such Fourier interpolation, the DOS can
be produced (see [[Lee1995]]), the phonon eigenenergies plotted along lines,
the slope of the energy versus cristalline momentum evaluated (to give sound
velocity).

The two-phonon sum and difference spectra can also be obtained, see
[[anaddb:dossum]].

For the related computation of temperature-dependent properties, see
[[topic_Temperature]].
