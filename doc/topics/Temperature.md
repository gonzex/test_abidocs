When the phonon band structure and corresponding eigenvectors are known over
the whole Brillouin Zone, thanks fo Fourier interpolation (see
[[topic:PhononBands]]), integrals can be performed, allowing to obtain a
wealth of properties, like free energy, entropy, specific heat, as well as
atomic temperature factors. For applications of this technique, see
[[Lee1995]].

Moreover, knowing such information for different volumes allows one to compute
the thermal expansion, see [[anaddb:gruns_ddbs]].

The input variables needed to perform the interpolation over the Brillouin
Zone are described in [[topic:PhononBands]] and are not listed again in the
present topic.
