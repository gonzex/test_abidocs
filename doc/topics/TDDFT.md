For finite systems (atoms and molecules), excited states can be computed
within TDDFT (Casida approach - only norm-conserving pseudopotentials). See
the explanations given in the [[lesson:tddft]] lesson of tutorial. The
[[iscf]] input variable must be set to -1.

In the non-spin-polarized case, spin-singlet as well as spin-triplet
excitations are computed. Spin-polarized case is also available.
