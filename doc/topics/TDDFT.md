This page gives hints on how to perform time-dependent density-functional theory calculations of neutral
excitation energies with the ABINIT package.

## Introduction

For finite systems (atoms and molecules), excited states can be computed
within TDDFT (Casida approach - only norm-conserving pseudopotentials). See
the explanations given in the [[lesson:tddft]] lesson of tutorial. The
[[iscf]] input variable must be set to -1.

In the non-spin-polarized case, spin-singlet as well as spin-triplet
excitations are computed. Spin-polarized case is also available.

* [The lesson on TDDFT](../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_tddft.html) deals with the computation of the excitation spectrum of finite systems, thanks to the Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory approach, in the Cassida formalism.
