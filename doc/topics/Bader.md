The postprocessor of ABINIT, called AIM (Atom-In-Molecule), performs the Bader
analysis on the basis of the charge density, norm-conserving pseudopotential
cases only, complemented by the core charge densities provided in
[[http://www.abinit.org/downloads/core_electron]]. There is a specific
[[help_aim]] for this ABINIT postprocessor.
