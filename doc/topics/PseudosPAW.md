This page gives hints on how to master the use of norm-conserving pseudopotentials and PAW atomic data, and
their consequences with the ABINIT package.

## Introduction

ABINIT can read many different types of norm-conserving pseudopotentials and
PAW atomic data. The names of the files to be used in an ABINIT run are to be
provided in the [[help:abinit#intro1|"files" file]], one for each
[[topic:AtomTypes|type of atom]]. Note that one cannot mix norm-conserving
pseudopotentials with PAW atomic data files in a single ABINIT run, even for
different datasets. One has to stick either to norm-conserving
pseudopotentials or to PAW.

**Norm-conserving pseudopotential tables**

There are several sets of norm-conserving pseudopotentials available for most
elements of the periodic table, either in LDA or in GGA-PBE. The
[[http://www.abinit.org/downloads/pseudodojo/pseudodojo|recommended one]]
(GGA-PBE, [[ixc]]=11) comes from the ONCVPSP generator (with spin-orbit
coupling). The Goedecker HGH table (LDA, [[ixc]]=1, also including spin-orbit
coupling) is also available, at [[http://www.abinit.org/downloads/psp-
links/psp-links/hgh]]. It is rather accurate, but requires often large
[[ecut]]. The old Troullier-Martins type tables (
[[http://www.abinit.org/downloads/psp-links/psp-links/lda_tm|LDA]] [[ixc]]=1
and [[http://www.abinit.org/downloads/psp-links/psp-links/gga_fhi|GGA]]
[[ixc]]=11) are deprecated, because not accurate enough, and also not
including spin-orbit coupling. The different format for norm-conserving
pseudopotentials are described in
[[https://wiki.abinit.org/doku.php?id=developers:pseudos]].

**PAW atomic data tables**

Five large sets of PAW atomic data can be read by ABINIT. The recommended one
(JTH) for both LDA and GGA-PBE is available on
[[http://www.abinit.org/downloads/PAW2/index.html|the ABINIT web site PAW
page]]. It uses the PAW-XML format. The links to other sets are provided in
the same Web page, see the end of the section "Documents and tools"

**Validation**

Many pseudopotentials (norm-conserving as well as PAW) have been tested
against all-electron calculations, see the section "Documents and tools"
paragraph about the "Delta" project on
[[http://www.abinit.org/downloads/PAW2/index.html|the ABINIT web site PAW
page]]. In [[lesson:paw3]] it is explained How to perform more detailed
comparisons with an all-electron code.

**Generation**

Six codes are available to generate new pseudopotentials when needed, see
[[http://www.abinit.org/downloads/atomic-data-files|the related ABINIT web
page]]. For norm-conserving pseudopotentials, ONCVPSP is the preferred one.
The ultra-soft pseudopotentials generated by "USPP" are approximations of the
Projector Augmented Wave approach, and are treated within the PAW framework in
ABINIT. The ATOMPAW generator is actually tightly connected to ABINIT such
that there are ABINIT automatic tests in which a PAW atomic data is generated,
and then used in ABINIT. There is also a dedicated tutorial to ATOMPAW/ABINIT.

**Miscellaneous**

Norm-conserving pseudopotentials can be mixed, to generate "alchemical"
pseudoatoms, see [[topic_AtomTypes]].
