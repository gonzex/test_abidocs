This page gives hints on how to use the Abipy ABINIT post-processor with the ABINIT package.

## Introduction

[[https://github.com/abinit/abipy|AbiPy]] is a Python library to analyze the
results produced by ABINIT. It also provides tools to generate input files and
workflows to automate ab-initio calculations and typical convergence studies.
AbiPy is interfaced with Pymatgen and this allows users to benefit from the
different tools and python objects available in the pymatgen ecosystem.

AbiPy can be used in conjunction with matplotlib, pandas, ipython and jupyter
thus providing a powerful and user-friendly environment for data analysis and
visualization. Check out the list of plotting scripts available in the
[[http://pythonhosted.org/abipy/examples/plot/index.html|examples/plot]]
gallery. To learn more about the integration between jupyter and AbiPy, visit
the collection of notebooks and the AbiPy lessons.
