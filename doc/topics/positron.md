This page gives hints on how to set parameters for a calculation with a positron in the system. with the ABINIT package.

## Introduction

The lifetime of positrons and their annihilation rate can be computed, using
the self-consistent two-component DFT, including force and stress computation,
LDA and GGA, norm-conserving as well as PAW [[Wiktor2015]]. Doppler broadening
can also be computed. The details of of the way to perform such calculations
is given in the description of the [[positron]] input variable, as well as in
[[lesson_positron|the lesson on electron-positron annihilation]].

Examples can be found in [[Wiktor2013]],[[Wiktor2014]],[[Wiktor2014a]] and
[[Wiktor2014b]].
