The DFPT theory to compute the elastic, piezoelectric and internal strain
tensors is presented in [[Hamann2005]].

See the [[topic:DFPT|generalities about DFPT]] as well as the tutorial
[[lesson_elastic]]. For the preliminary runs of ABINIT, see [[rfstrs]], while
for ANADDB, see [[anaddb:elaflag]] for the elastic tensor, and
[[anaddb:piezoflag]] for the piezoelectric tensor.
