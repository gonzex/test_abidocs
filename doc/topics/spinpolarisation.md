The electronic system may be computed in the spin-unpolarized or spin-
polarized case, with the possibility to impose occupation numbers of majority
and minority spins, and the spins of the starting configuration. A specific
option for efficient treatment of anti-ferromagnetism (Shubnikov groups) is
available. The treatment of non-collinear magnetism is available (some details
of the implementation can de found [here](../documents/noncol.pdf)). The total
magnetic moment of the unit cell can be constrained. The local magnetization
can also be constrained.
