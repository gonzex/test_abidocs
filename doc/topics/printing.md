Many quantities are computed, but not reported in the main ABINIT output file.  
On demand, they can be printed thanks to the following
prt&amp;langle;suffix&amp;rangle; input variables. Usually, a corresponding
file suffixed with _&amp;langle;suffix&amp;rangle; will be printed. In other
cases, the main output will be modified to contain the data.
