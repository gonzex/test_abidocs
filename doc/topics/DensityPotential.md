This page gives hints on how to analyze the densities and potentials with the ABINIT package.

## Introduction

All the files that have the density and potential format, see
[[topic_printing]] can be analyzed with the "Cut3D" postprocessor. In
particular, it can produce two-dimensional cuts (or one-dimensional cuts)
through the three-dimensional data, suitable for later visualisation using
e.g. [[topic:Abipy]]. It can perform the Hirshfeld computation of atomic
charges. It can analyse the charge contained in an atomic sphere, and
determine the angular momentum projected charge (l=0 to 4) contained in that
sphere. (only available for norm-conserving pseudopotentials)

See the [[help_cut3D]], as well as the [[tutorial_AnalysisTools]].
