With a computer, one can consider non-physical modifications of the system to
help the understanding the physics ...

The nuclear masses and free electron mass can be modified. A fake space
dependent chemical potenial can be added, see [[chempot]], as well as the
electrostatic potential of a slab, [[jellslab]]. A simple sine/cosine
potential with a wavevector compatible with the (super)call can also be added,
see [[qprtrb]].
