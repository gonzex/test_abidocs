Isolated Carbon atom Test the mGGA functionals generating directly XC potentials. Similar to test 08,  but with smaller acell and ecut. Without the use of a "large" xc_denpos,  Tran-Blaha is hard to converge. Hypothesis : there is a strong non-linear region,  preventing the Anderson method to work effectively. Note that the default iscf (=7) does not allow to converge with the default xc_denpos ! By contrast,  things are much better behaved with xc_denpos on the order of 1.0e-7 .

Argon solid,  experimental lattice parameter. Realistic parameters are used (ecut=20,  ngkpt=2x2x2 shifted 4 times,  but centered on Gamma). Test the mGGA functional from Tran and Blaha (correction to Becke-Johnson). The LDA gap is observed at Gamma : 8.071 eV,  is in reasonable agreement with the gap from the TB paper PRL 102,  226401 (2009), where it is mentioned to be 8.16 eV. The mGGa gap is 14.688 eV. The TB paper mentions 13.91 eV. The experimental value is 14.20 eV. The reading of the kinetic energy density,  to start a non-SCF calculation is not yet implemented, as of ABINITv6.12.0 . This test was used to examine the speed of the convergence in case of elongated cells,  up to 16 atoms. The mGGA convergence was found to be similar to the LDA convergence. Also,  test non-self-consistent mGGA calculation,  with reading of the previously produced _DEN and _KDEN files.

Computation of phonons and response to electric field within PAW (both q=0 and q/=0) Test on AlAs structure inspired by v6/t62. Ground state,  DDK,  effective charges and dielectric tensor are computed. Phonon modes at q=0 are computed. Phonon modes at q=(1/4, 0, 0) and q=(-1/4, 1/2/1/4) are computed. Note: Charge neutrality is not achieved with the present dataset, but can be easily reached by increasing some parameters;  for instance: (ngkpt 8 8 8,  ecut 15.,  pawecutdg 30.) gives Z(Al)=2.1184310,  Z(As)=-2.1184804

Calculation of the electron-phonon band structure renormalisation for Diamond, due to the phonon at the Gamma point. The computation with ecut=20 Ha and elph2_imagden 0.0 gives 24.482 meV for the HOMO shift at Gamma,  while the finite-difference of phonon frequencies gives 28.975 meV,  in excellent agreement with frozen-phonon changes of HOMO eigenenergy. The difference is due to the Non-Site-Diagonal Debye-Waller contribution,  that was explicitly obtained by a finite-difference approach.

Isolated Helium atom (see below). Treated without any XC energy (ixc=0). The total energy is -1.9442 Ha. 10.-20. Isolated Helium atom tests. These tests exercise different xc functionals,  in the spin-unpolarized case. The helium atom is isolated in a box of size 5x5x5,  with one special point (1/4 1/4 1/4),  200 Ha cut-off,  used with a potential close to the bare He potential (erfc with 0.001 bohr decay length). Errors due to the smallness of the supercell size are on the order of 1 mHa,  as well as those due to the representation of the Coulomb potential by a erfc function. The remaining is due to finiteness of the basis set. The estimation of the latter errors is presented in the test_cases 17 and 18. In all these tests,  intxc=0.

### [[tests/v1/Input/t25.in]]   

Isolated Hydrogen atom. Treated with the Fermi-Amaldi correction (ixc=20),  so that this corresponds to exact cancellation of the Hartree and XC contributions, as it should for Hydrogen atom. Examine the 1s-2s splitting,  that should be equal to 0.375 Ha, and is obtained at 0.368 Ha (so within 2%),  with the chosen ecut and acell. This quantity converges much faster to the correct value than either the total energy or the 1s eigenenergy. Also test effmass_free. A value 10 times bigger than the usual electron mass leads to a 10-fold contraction of the system. The 1s-2s splitting is multiplied by 10 exactly,  provided ecut,  acell and the smearing of the potential at origin are scaled appropriately.

Molybdenum slab : 5 layers of Mo + 3 layers of vacuum,  ixc=0 . Central layer is slightly displaced,  to break the symmetry. Metallic occupation numbers. Only 20 bands,  while at least 15 are needed. Use iscf=2,  start with default metallic preconditioner, damped (diemix=0.5d0). A factor of 2 is gained at each iteration. Then evaluate RPA matrix eigenvalues using the extrapolation,  and including the metallic correction. Largest are 3.2541E+01  1.2089E+01  6.1305E+00 . Then,  uses the dielectric matrix preconditioning to converge. No damping is needed. A factor of about 10 is gained at each iteration on average.

Analyze a DDB for Silicon. Lattice parameter = 10.18 Angstrom. Here,  IFCs are obtained,  and can be compared to those published in Table I of Rignanese et al,  PRB53,  4488 (1996). For example,  the atoms numbers for NN=0, 1, 2, 5 in Table I are found as atoms 1, 5, 17, 20. The numbers are equal in the paper or in the output of the code. The frequencies at X and L points are also computed. They can be compared with those provided in TABLE II (TA(X) mode at 140.466 cm-1) and TABLE III (TA(L) mode at 108.626 cm-1) in the above-mentioned paper. The numbers are equal in the paper or in the output of the code. Thermodynamic quantities are also obtained. The input parameters of the code does not give particularly well converged quantities (one needs reasonable CPU time for testing !), but it is OK for comparison with the paper. In the output of the code,  a mole corresponds to the number of Avogadro times one CELL. As a Silicon cell contains 2 atoms,  caution must be taken in the comparison with experiment ! We will refer to the numbers given by the code as being given for a mole-cell (in short a mol-c). The distinction between the usual definition of a mole (Avogadro number times 1 Silicon atom) and a mole-cell (Avogadro number times 2 Silicon atom) was unfortunately the source of errors in the paper by Rignanese et al (our thanks to Steve Erwin for noticing this - an errata should be written). From the output of the code ( zero Kelvin is approximated by results at 1 Kelvin) : the zero point contribution to the Helmholtz free energy is 11.90 kJ/mol-c,  so 5.95 kJ/mole;  the entropy at 298.15K is 38.25 J/(mol-c.K),  so 19.12 J/(mole.K);  the constant-volume specific heat at 298.15K is 39.59 J/(mol-c.K),  so 19.80 J/(mole.K); the change in F (Helmholtz free energy) from 1 K to 298.15 K is -4.91 kJ/mol-c,  so -2.45 kJ/mole;  the change in E (internal energy) from 1 K to 298.15 K is 6.49 kJ/mol-c,  so 3.25 kJ/mole. Supposing that we take the usual definition of a mole (Avogadro number times 1 Silicon atom),  then,  in the above-mentioned paper,  the FIG. 3,  5 and 8 should be rescaled,  as well as the zero-point contribution to the Helmholtz free energy (5.95 kJ/mole,  and not 12 J/mole - the 'k' was also missing),  that is only 1.25% of the cohesive energy. The output of the code is now more clear than in 1995,  and this kind of error should not appear anymore.

### [[tests/v2/Input/t17.in]]   

Analyze a DDB for Silicon. Lattice parameter = 10.18 Angstrom. IFCs are computed as in test 16,  but by limiting artificially the number of allowed interacting shells to 2. The total number of atoms to be taken into account is 17 (1 for the shell 0, 4 for the shell 1,  and 12 for the shell 2). The frequencies at X and L points are again computed. They can be compared with those provided in TABLE II (TA(X) mode at 161.684 cm-1) and TABLE III (TA(L) mode at 127.508 cm-1) in the above-mentioned paper. The number are close,  with small differences at the level of 0.001 cm-1 .

### [[tests/v2/Input/t22.in]]   

Analyze a DDB for ZrO2,  containing only the dynamical matrices at Gamma,  X and L. Generate the IFC using a rough sampling,  based on Gamma and X only,  then produces the phonon band structure along Gamma-X, as well as in L. The degeneracies can be compared with those of Detraux et al,  Phys. Rev. Lett. 81,  3297 (1998). The errors produced with this sampling are still large,  as can be judged from the comparison at L. The frequencies (in cm-1) from the DDB are 128.8 (2-deg),  271.4,  413.7 (2-deg),  518.2,  521.8 (2-deg),  598.1; while from the IFCs,  using the interpolation,  they are 152.5 (2-deg),  290.8,  429.6 (2-deg),  434.6 (2-deg),  551.9,  576.0 . The same DDB allows to generate a slightly better sampling,  by using nqshft=2 and two shifts (0.0 0.0 0.0) and (0.5 0.5 0.5). In this case,  the L point is used for the interpolation. The comparison can be done at the level of the mid-point between Gamma and X : from the GX grid,  one gets 107.0 (2-deg),  260.3,  295.5 (2-deg),  394.3,  577.0 (2-deg),  682.1; from the GXL grid,  one gets 106.3 (2-deg),  262.6,  302.7 (2-deg),  403.8,  582.5 (2-deg),  684.2; while directly from the ABINIT code,  one gets 106.3 (2-deg),  270.0,  277.9 (2-deg),  443.2,  581.6 (2-deg),  681.6  . This is not yet satisfactory. More points are needed for better results,  the next interesting grid being obtained by changing ngqpt from 2 2 2 to 4 4 4 in the t22.in file. Two additional dynamical matrices are then needed.

Generate first-order responses for GaAs (zinc-blende). Aim at a regular sampling of phonon wavevectors,  needed to interpolate the dynamical matrix over the whole Brillouin Zone, in test 32. The chosen grid (too coarse,  though) has only two special q points : 1/4 1/4 1/4 and 1/4 1/2 1/2 (in reduced coordinates). The Gamma point is also needed,  especially for the computation of dielectric matric and effective charges,  needed to get the asymptotic behaviour of the interatomic force constants. To generate the different responses,  the following steps are followed, with each of them corresponding to a different dataset (the multi-dataset mode allows to have only one input file) : 1) ground state calculation,  with a k-point sampling in the irreducible Brillouin zone only; 2) using the density of 1),  computation of the wavefunctions for the grid of k-points in the full Brillouin zone;  (not really needed in v3.0) 3) computation of the ddk response,  in preparation to the electric field response; 4) computation of the dynamical matrix at Gamma,  as well as the Born effective charges,  and the dielectric tensor; 5) using the density of 1),  computation of the GS wavefunctions at k+q where q is 1/4 1/4 1/4; 6) computation of the dynamical matrix at 1/4 1/4 1/4; 7) using the density of 1),  computation of the GS wavefunctions at k+q where q is 1/4 1/2 1/2; 8) computation of the dynamical matrix at 1/4 1/2 1/2 .

### [[tests/v2/Input/t32.in]]   

The derivative database generated by case 31 is now analyzed,  and serves to compute a phonon band structure. There is a very small breaking of the symmetry-induced degeneracy of modes along the (x x x) direction. This is due to an incomplete convergence. Indeed,  if one makes tolwfr more stringent for response calculations (from 1.0d-16 to 1.0d-20),  the lowest acoustic modes at (0.1 0.1 0.1),  that are 4.042cm-1 and 4.067cm-1,  becomes 4.05398 cm-1 and 4.05400 cm-1 . Of course,  this effect cannot be seen for other modes,  since only the acoustic modes are sensitive to that level of accuracy !

The direct computation of forces at the target geometry gives -3.145833725869 . The agreement is perfect, taking into account the "limited" number of digits (10) of the finite-difference result. 2) Computation of the second-order derivative of the total energy With delta(xred)=0.0002,  one gets delta(dedt)/delta(xred)=188.73875 With delta(xred)=0.0001,  one gets delta(dedt)/delta(xred)=188.73837 The combination of both results,  in a higher-order finite difference formula gives 188.73824613 .

### [[tests/v3/Input/t16.in]]   

Si crystal. GGA + non-linear XC core correction. Compute the interatomic force constant for the displacement of the second atom along (111). RF calculation of the 2DTE gives 7.51663417 Ha while finite differences gives: with delta(xred)=0.0001,  7.15663267 Ha. The agreement is quite good,  and might likely be improved by combining finite differences. Also compute the ddk and electric field responses. The number of k points is much too small to obtain physical values,  but are quite comparable to the result of test v2 #6

Orthorhombic Al system,  q(1/2 0 0),  partial occupation numbers. Compares with frozen-phonon calculations. Similar to test v2 #11,  except use of PBE GGA. Examine two cases: varying occupation numbers,  and fixed occupation numbers. A. Varying occupation numbers (occopt=4): RF calculation in dataset 5 gives 2DE equal to -4.053115 Ha,  while finite difference of "TOTAL" energy (datasets 6 and 7,  including entropy term) gives -4.0475002 Ha. This is fair,  BUT it does not improve with a better finite-difference,  so there is a problem. B. Fixed occupation numbers (occopt=2): RF calculation in dataset 8 gives 2DE equal to +5.394365 Ha,  while finite difference of total energy (no entropy term is present with occopt=2) gives +5.3998556 Ha This is fair,  BUT it does not improve with a better finite-difference,  so there is a problem. Then,  in dataset 11,  compute phonon frequencies at Gamma of the doubled cell. The 2DTE is 10.7997781 Ha,  which corresponds to 5.3998890 Ha,  so in much better agreement with the frozen-phonon calculation. TO BE UNDERSTOOD ...

N2 molecule non-spin-polarized,  in a big box. Compute excitation energies,  as well as Cauchy coefficients. The Cauchy (-2) coefficient is the low-frequency optical polarisability. The present test uses a small box (6x5x5 Angstrom), a small energy cut-off (25 Ha),  and only 12 states. Two different exchange-correlation functionals are treated : ixc=1 (Teter93), and ixc=7 (PW92). Experimental values are taken from Goerling at al, J. Chem. Phys. 110,  2785 (1999)). Experimental values for the singlet excitation energies are : 1pi_g 9.31eV  1sig_u- 9.92eV  1del_u 10.27eV The present test gives 1pi_g 9.47eV  1sig_u- 9.91eV  1del_u 10.45eV With a larger box (8x7x7) 1pi_g 9.33eV  1sig_u- 9.84eV  1del_u 10.38eV With a larger cutoff (60Ha) 1pi_g 9.38eV  1sig_u- 9.77eV  1del_u 10.31eV With a larger number of states (30) 1pi_g 9.44eV  1sig_u- 9.91eV  1del_u 10.45eV Experimental values for the Cauchy coefficients are: (These values should be updated,  the real ones are smaller by a few percent,  because a buffer has been introduced in tddft.f) (-2) 11.74au,  (-4) 30.11au,  (-6) 101.8au The present test gives (-2) 8.012au,  (-4) 27.83au,  (-6) 108.4au With a larger box (8x7x7) (-2) 7.112au,  (-4) 25.51au,  (-6) 102.2au With a larger cutoff (60Ha) (-2) 7.717au,  (-4) 26.87au,  (-6) 104.6au With a larger number of states (30) (-2) 11.70au,  (-4) 34.56au,  (-6) 123.3au (The larger number of states is important to give reasonable values ...)

MgO FCC crystal,  Bader analysis. Examine the Oxygen atom only. Determine correctly 18 bonding critical points, 24 ring critical points,  and 8 cage critical points. (In agreement with Euler's relation : #BCP-#RCP+#CCP=2) The bonding critical points are quite accurate, while for the ring critical points,  the criteria defined by the input variables lstep and lgrad are not fulfilled for all the CP. The coordinates are rather inaccurate. In particular,  the symmetry between RCP is broken. This is seen the most clearly at the level of the laplacian eigenvalues. This breaking of symmetry naturally originates from the fact that the FFT grid is not symmetric (the lattice was chosen primitive FCC), so that the finite elements used for the interpolation are also not symmetric. This cannot be improved by just tuning the numerical parameters. Instead,  one should consider the Bader analysis in a FCC conventional cell,  instead of the primitive one. Get 2 core electrons,  7.6796 valence electrons. The nucleus charge is +8. The Oxygen atom-in-molecule has a net charge of -1.6796.

O2 (non-spin-polarized,  non-linear XC core correction,  LDA) Fixed occupation numbers This is to demonstrate a subtlety of the analysis of finite differences : the effect of the symmetrization. In dataset 1-3,  one computes the total energy and forces, with automatic computation of symmetries,  including symmetrization of the forces (or reduced gradients). The reduced gradients with respect to displacements of the first atom along z in datasets 1 and 3 are -5.705435136802 Ha and -5.692472863816 Ha,  giving the 2DTE of 129.62 Ha. In dataset 4,  the RF 2DTE is computed,  and the agreement with finite-differences of datasets 1 and 3 is quite bad: 127.90998027 Ha,  1.5% error ! However,  the agreement with the finite differences of forces in datasets 5 and 6 (-5.705349696912 Ha and -5.692558689744 Ha),  where the symmetrization of forces is not done,  is excellent : the finite-difference gives 127.91007168 Ha,  less than 0.0001 Ha error. Explanation : forces in the geometry of datasets 1, 3, 5 and 6 are not really symmetric,  because of the underlying FFT grid, used for the evaluation of the XC functional ! This can be seen in the fulfillment of the acoustic sum rule. With the present low-cutoff,  the frequency of the acoustic mode is 264i cm-1,  a strong breaking of the sum rule. With 20Ha, the frequency is 43.18 cm-1,  much better. Other values : 25 Ha,  19.03i cm-1, 30 Ha,  21.02i cm-1, 35 Ha,  20.14i cm-1, 50 Ha,   3.57  cm-1 Note the (misleading) plateau between 25 Ha and 35 Ha : the convergence towards 0 cm-1 start again only beyond 35 Ha. The influence of the FFT grid depends strongly on the pseudopotential.

O2 (non-spin-polarized,  non-linear XC core correction,  LDA) Metallic occupation numbers. For metallic occupation numbers, RF computation of 2DTE at Gamma,  when taking Fermi energy changes (frzfermi=0),  will give the same answer than finite-difference of GS computations. However,  prior to v4.4,  the change of Fermi energy due to the perturbation was not computed. This corresponds to calculations performed with frzfermi=1 (should be used only for testing purposes). In dataset 1-3,  one computes the total energy and forces, without symmetries,  as it should be for accurate finite-difference tests. The reduced gradients with respect to displacements of the first atom along z in datasets 1 and 3 are -5.705344113253 Ha and -5.692553418498 Ha,  giving the 2DTE of 127.90 Ha. In dataset 4,  RF is computed with the Fermi energy correction, and the agreement with finite-differences of datasets 1 and 3 is good : one gets 127.9068 Ha . In dataset 5,  RF is computed with frozen Fermi energy and the disagreement with finite-differences of datasets 1 and 3 is large: one gets 100.9991668 Ha .

H2 molecule : examine the rotational freedom. The present test produces the following vibrational frequencies (with degeneracies indicated): 56.89 i cm-1 (2) 0.41   cm-1 (2) 1.05   cm-1 3800    cm-1 The large frequency corresponds to the stretching mode,  and has the right order of magnitude. The frequencies close to 1 cm-1 corresponds to translation modes,  and are small enough for usual applications. The  56.89 i cm-1 mode corresponds to rotation of the H2 molecule. The magnitude of this frequency might seem quite large. Here are the results of tests made to understand this phenomenon. First,  note that ecut 12  acell 3*14 Increasing the value of ecut to 25 decreases the magnitude of the frequency to 36.8 cm-1 . However,  in order to continue to make it smaller, the cell size must be increased,  and an oscillatory behaviour is observed : 3*16   45.6 i cm-1 3*18   22.7   cm-1 3*20   19.1 i cm-1 3*22   15.7 i cm-1 3*24   13.7   cm-1 Many other tests have been set up. In particular, it was observed that the frequency of the oscillatory behaviour changes with the ecut,  and also that using the Gamma point,  instead of the 1/4 1/4 1/4 k point (used in this test) degrades the convergence. The overall picture is as follows. There are different reasons for the translation and rotation modes to acquire a non-zero frequency when plane waves and supercells are used. Still,  as concerns translations,  only the existence of a discretization of the XC grid is important. For rotations,  supercell effects are also present : - alignement of dipole or quadrupoles - interaction between tails of wavefunctions,  accross cells Since the convergence in supercell size is oscillatory,  we infer that the breaking of the rotational invariance is mostly due to interaction between wavefunction tails. This will be checked by confining the system in a spherical well,  in a forthcoming test.

Test of the pspcod=8 input format (contributed by D.R. Hamann) This format is primarily intended to offer a flexible platform for those who wish to experiment with their own features in norm-conserving pseudopotentials.  A full description and discussion is given in Infos/Psp_infos/psp8.info.  This test case,  CaO,  is an example of self-interaction-corrected pseudopotentials in the style of D. Vogel,  P. Krueger,  and J. Pollmann,  Phys. Rev. B 52, 14 316 (1995).  The bandgap (direct) in the test example,  11.2eV, is in excellent agreement with experiment,  but is rather strongly dependent on the radius at which the self-interaction-correction of Ca is (smoothly) cut off.  The sic pseudopotentials used in this test should not be considered anything but early-stage experiments and should not be used for any other purpose.

Bader charge is 12.0357,  while it should be exactly 12 (10 core electrons and 2 valence electrons). The error is mostly due to insufficient angular sampling (only 5 theta and 5 phi in an octant). Going to (10, 10) gives 11.9928, and (20, 20) gives 11.9980. But in the latter case, the CPU time required is multiplied by about 10 when compared to the present setting.

MgO molecule,  Bader analysis. Examine the Oxygen atom only. Determine 2 bonding critical points (only !), 8 ring critical points,  and 8 cage critical points. (In agreement with Euler's relation : #BCP-#RCP+#CCP=2) The ecut that was used in test case 32 is quite low,  so that the accuracy of the critical points is not too good. Especially,  symmetries are broken at the level of 0.0003. Get 2 core electrons,  6.8043 valence electrons. The nucleus charge is +8. The Oxygen atom-in-molecule has a net charge of -0.8043. Additional explanation about the weak number of BCP for oxygen. One might expect the O atom to be connected through the other O atoms in neighbouring cells (x and y directions - hence 4 BCPs in these directions),  but one sees that the only existing BCPs are towards the Mg atoms. This is surprising,  but correct ! Indeed, the density at the middle of the segment between two O atoms along x (or y) is LOWER than the density at the middle of the segment between two Mg atoms along x (or y). Indeed,  although the O atoms attract electrons from the Mg atoms,  they become negatively charged,  and the potential, in DISTANT regions of the molecule,  is lower (so more attractive) on the side of the Mg atoms than on the side of the O atoms ! This means that the tail of the density extends further in the x-y plane containing the Mg atoms,  than in the x-y plane containing the O atoms. So,  the middle of the segment connecting the O atoms actually belongs to the Mg basin of attraction,  and is close to a Cage Critical Point shared by Oxygen and Magnesium atoms. By contrast,  the middle of the segment connecting the Mg atoms is,  as expected, close to a Bond Critical Point.

MgO molecule,  Bader analysis. Examine the Magnesium atom only. This is a pathological case for the currently implemented algorithm : the Bader volume is not convex ! Determine correctly 6 bonding critical points, but only finds 4 ring critical points,  and not even one cage critical point ! (Euler's relation #BCP-#RCP+#CCP=2 is fulfilled,  but the number of RCP or CCP is not right) Despite that fact that the critical points are not all found,  one can proceed with the other steps of the Bader approach : the CP are only used to get an estimation of the minimal and maximal radii of the Bader surface ! Get 9.8533 core electrons,  1.3388 valence electrons, for a total of 11.1922 electrons. The nucleus charge is +12. The Magnesium atom-in-molecule has a net charge of -0.8078 . Comparing with case 33,  one sees that the charge neutrality is violated at the level of 0.0035 electron charge. This is quite good,  but a bit lucky. For a better charge neutrality,  one has to integrate better on the angles phi and theta (increase nphi and ntheta),  and also to increase the ecut of the preliminary abinit run. In any case,  with the pathology of the Mg Bader volume (being not convex),  one will miss some charge. It should be pretty small,  and might even be neglected for all practical purposes (the Bader analysis is just a trend analysis,  anyhow) Nevertheless,  in this particular case of the MgO molecule,  there is a fundamental limit of this algorithm...

One He atom in a big simple cubic box Compute the DOS using the tetrahedron method. Also compute the partial DOS. There is a quite surprising feature of this very simple DOS, that might seem to be due to a bug,  but is NOT one. Indeed,  the obtained DOS is not continuous (vizualize the result of DATASET 2):  at two energies,  there is a small,  but sizeable jump. This feature is associated with a rather sparse sampling of the Brillouin zone. Indeed,  some of the tetrahedra have three corners with perfectly identical energies. Such a set of corners belong to two different tetrahedra. If there is not an equal slope of energy when moving away from each sides of the triangles,  in the different tetrahedra, the DOS is discontinuous at the energy of the three shared corners. (explanation found by M. Verstraete)

Test of the strain perturbation with the GGA Note that this test and the following one,  59, address more advanced features of strain perturbation than the ones going with number 60 to 79,  and were developed later,  but were placed here for convenience). AlAs in the zincblende structure,  with a choice of pseudopotenials that include model core charges.  In the LDA,  the strain perturbation simply introduces perturbing charge densities leading to perturbing first-order potentials in a straightforward manner.  (This perturbation does act differently on the valence and model core charges.)   The GGA is a non-trivial extension, since strain perturbs the gradient operator itself.  This test is a symmetrized and stripped-down version of a test case used in development which yielded agreement between such RF calculations and numerical derivatives of GS stresses and forces to 1.e-8 to 1.e-9 atomic units for the elastic tensor and intenal strain coupling parameters.  Acheiving this agreement does require forcing a considerably more dense fft grid than the default which is accepted here. (ngfft= 50 50 50 was used.)  While only the PBE GGA is tested here,  all forms present in Abinit should give comparably accurate results.

### [[tests/v4/Input/t60.in]]   

Test of the the effect of the first-order Fermi energy on a Q=0 phonon calculation in metals. The example is for a hypothetical intermetallic compound MgAl2, in a structure which can be thought of as fcc Al with every third (111) layer replaced by Mg.  Technically,  this is the hexagonal CdI2 structure,  space group #164,  P-3 m 1.  For this case,  neglect of this contribution yields approximately a 2% error in the largest interatomic force constants.  Its effect on many force constants for this system cancels because of symmetry.  This calculation is not particularly well converged,  especially with respect to k sample.  A well-converged version is in excellent agreement with interatomic force constants calculated by numerical differentiation of ground-state forces.

### [[tests/v4/Input/t61.in]]   

Test of the strain perturbation. Si in the usual diamond structrure using a Troullier-Martins potential including a model core charge.  The datasets include an initial ground state run,  2 pairs of 5 ground state runs with incrementally strained lattice vectors rprim (xx and yz strains -0.00004,  -0.00002,  0,  0.00002,  0.00004), and one response function run for the strain 2nd derivatives. This set is illustrative of the kind of testing used extensively in developing the strain perturbation portions of the code. The numerical 2nd derivatives of the energy wrt strains were computed by applying a 5-point derivative formula to ucvol*sigma(i, j), where the sigmas are the stresses calculated in the series of ground state calculations.  These agree with the analytic 2nd derivatives calculated in the response function run to ~1.E-7 for the data given here.  The cartesian internal strain (mixed second derivative wrt strain and atomic coordinate) agrees to ~1E-8. Note that such numerical tests of the internal strain are only valid if the forces are zero (relaxed or by symmetry).  Otherwise,  the reduced-coordinate 2nd derivatives must be used for such tests because the conversion to cartesian coordinates is itself strain- dependent and will introduce changes in the computed derivatives. In the actual development tests,  stricter converence criteria were used (tolvrs=1.E-24) as well as larger cutoffs,  and agreement was obtained at the 1.E-9 level.  The model core charge contributes the largest component of the error. ADDITIONAL NOTE : It should be noted that numerical derivative tests of the internal strain should be done by comparing the "2nd-order matrix" with numerical strain derivatives of the gradients wrt reduced atomic coordinates. These are not normally part of the GS output,  but can be obtained by uncommenting the DEBUG section at the end of prtxf.F90. Comparisons between numerical strain derivatives of the cartesian forces and the cartesian internal strain tensor will be incorrect unless the coordinates have been relaxed and the forces are zero within a tight tolerance.

Test of the strain perturbation. LaAs in a randomly distorted version of its normal rocksalt structure using a non-standard norm conserving potential produced by DRH for this test.  Distorted structures were used for most development work so that no components of the strain 2nd derivatives would be zero by symmetry.  A La compound was chosen because its f nonlocal potential makes a significant contribution to the result (10% for a well-converged result although only 1% for the low value of ecut used here),  so it tests that the very complex routines for the strain derivatives of the nonlocal energy are behaving properly.  (Choices in constructing this La potential were restricted by current limitations of the treatment of fhi- format potentials,  and it should not be used for physics results.)

Test of the strain perturbation. GaAs in a hypothetical wurzite (hexagonal) strucure,  using HGH potentials.  The main point here is to test the strain derivatives in a hexagonal symmetry situation.  The indexing of the strain components is pert=natom+3 for 3 uniaxial components,  and pert=natom+4 for 3 shear components,  translating in this case to (dir,  pert,  cartesian strain) triplets 1 7 xx          1 8 yz 2 7 yy          2 8 xz 3 7 zz          3 8 xy We see that the cartesian 2nd-order matrix has the expected symmetry despite the lack of any x<->y symmetry operations in this space group. A curious user might wish to extend this test to all strain components (rfstrs2  3;  rfdir2 1 1 1) and observe an unexpected symmetry among the cartesian internal strain terms.  In particular, certain diagonal and shear terms are identical,  such as 1 1 1 7 (x,  xx) and 2 1 3 8 (y,  xy) where (., .) means (force,  strain).

### [[tests/v4/Input/t64.in]]   

Test of the strain perturbation for metals. Al in the standard fcc structure using the gth potential. An issue with metals is that the fermi energy has a non-zero derivative wrt at least some of the strain perturbations. Modifications of the "active space" content restored to the first-order wavefunction (in vtowfk3.f) were implemented to reflect the resulting strain contributions.  The fermi energy derivative (itself a 1st-order quantity) depends on the self- consistent first-order potential,  and thus plays a role in the response-function self-consistency loop. As of 4.4.x,  a new treatment of the first-order fermi energy significantly improves the rate of convergence and allows all self-consistency algorithms. The results here are in very good agreement with numerical derivatives of ground state calculations with the same input parameters.  However, the kpt sample is far from converged and completely inadequate for real calculations.

Test of the strain perturbation for the rigid-ion piezoelectric tensor.  AlP in the zincblende structure but incorporating a rhombohedral distortion of the unit cell to make more tensor components non-zero.  The values of ecut and ngkpt are much too small for convergence,  and tolwfs should be set smaller,  probably 1.E-18 to 1.E-24. A full calculation of the set of d/dk wave functions in dataset 2 is needed,  idir2 = 1 1 1,  even though idir3 = 1 0 0 in dataset 3, since all d/dk components are needed to compute the cartesian piezoelectric tensor.  The only execptions to this are primitive orthorhombic,  tetragonal,  or cubic lattices with their primitive lattice vectors aligned with the cartesian axes.

### [[tests/v4/Input/t66.in]]   

Test of the strain perturbation for the rigid-ion piezoelectric tensor.  Rhombohedrally distorted AlP as in the previous test,  but using a ground-state finite- difference calculation of the d/dk wave functions.  Such calculations were used extensively to test the response function piezoelectric tensor by comparison to numerical derivatives of the ground-state polarization.  Using the same k sample in the ground state and response function calculations,  excellent agreement has been obtained in a variety of cases (including a better-converged version of this one).  Results using the finite- diffrence d/dk and the analytic d/dk as in the preceeding test agree in the limit of large k sample. The analytic form converges much more rapidly,  and is consistent with the slowly converging polarization numerical derivatives. The present version of this calculation uses berryopt = -2 to utilize the routine berryphase_new.f The ground-state polarization calculations used to compute the numerical derivatives in such tests should also be computed using berryphase_new.f setting berryopt = -1 and rfdir = 1 1 1 so that the cartesian polarization is automatically generated. This eliminates several issues that needed special attention using berryopt = 1 and the original berryphase.f routine. The resulting cartesian polarization derivatives represent the "improper" piezoelectric tensor,  and have to be corrected to yield the "proper" tensor as described in D. Vanderbilt,  J. Phys. Chem. Solids 61,  147 (2000),  using Eq.(15).  The response-function calculation gives the proper piezoelectric tensor.  Only the electron response,  and not the strain-induced movement of the rigid ions contributes to the proper tensor.

Test of the computation of the positron lifetime (using the two-component DFT) within PAW. A cubic box with 4 Al atoms at experimental volume. Low cut-offs,  few k-points. Datasets 2 to 3 use ixcpositron=2 i.e. LDA electron-positron correlation provided by Puska, Seitsonen,  and Nieminen (PRB 52,  10947). Datasets 4 to 5 use ixcpositron=11 i.e. LDA zero positron density limit parametrized by Arponen and Pajanne and fitted by Sterne and Kaiser (PRB 43,  13892). Dataset 1 performs a simple electronic GS calculation and store the density. Dataset 2 performs a positronic GS calculation in presence of the electronic density computed by dataset 1 (positron=1). Dataset 3 performs an electronic GS calculation in presence of the positronic density computed by dataset 2 (positron=2). Dataset 4 performs an automatic electronic/positronic GS calculation without storage of the wave-functions (positron=-1). Dataset 5 performs an automatic electronic/positronic GS calculation with storage of the wave-functions (positron=-10). Each dataset computes the positron lifetime and annihilation rate after the SCF iterations.

Ni molecule in a big box. Test the use of the atvshift variable First dataset : no shift,  the ten states number 9 to 18 come from the 3d atomic states,  the state number 19 is a bonding 4s state. States number 16 and 17 are degenerate 3d pi antibonding states (m=1 and -1). State number 18 is a 3d sigma antibonding state (m=0). Second dataset : add a 0.001 atomic shift to the m=0 potential. Most of the levels change by less than 0.0002 (and their energy decrease),  except state number 9 (a 3d sigma bonding state (m=0)),  that goes from -0.24020 to -0.23982 (+0.0004) and state number 18,  that goes from -0.15439 to 0.15399 (+0.0004). Third dataset : add a 0.001 atomic shift to the m=1 and m=-1 potentials. All the levels are affected (likely the m=1 and -1 orbitals adjust,  and cause modification of the potential),  but the states 10,  11,  16,  and 17 increase their energy,  while the other state see their energy decrease. Acting separately on the m=1 potential or the m=-1 cause (correctly) the breaking of the degeneracy. This test was not easy to make portable. The problem lies in the fact that when the density becomes negative,  due to Bragg oscillations,  the xc kernel can be extremely large,  and when use for the prediction of the residual of the forces,  the differences between machines can be extremely large. IN order to see this effect,  put ecut 7 and npulayit 7 (its default value).

Crystalline Silicon to test the CP2K pseudopotential implementation with the new pseudo type: pspcod 10 (same formalism as HGH pseudos,  pspcod 3). Same input file as t35.in of tests/tutorial,  the only difference is that in the test the used pseudo is taken from the CP2K library. (http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/cp2k/potentials/Goedecker/abinit/) The bandstructure is in agreement with that calculated in the tutorial example with the pspcod=1 pseudopotential.

N2 molecule non-spin-polarized,  but treated with nsppol=2,  in a big box. Similar to test 55 of tests/v3. There should be only small numerical differences with respect to datasets 1 and 2 of this test, due to the fact that the tetragonal symmetry was here slightly broken for sake of portability of the automatic test. Note however that the singlet and triplet states cannot be disentagled, so one gets a big list of excitations,  the merge of singlet and triplet excitations.

For the first two excitations,  one finds : 2.40967E+00 eV,  doubly degenerate  (Pi excitation) 3.94165E+00 eV  (Sigma+ excitation) They come mainly from the 2nd occupied Kohn-Sham state,  spin up. The third excitation,  at 5.11592E+00 eV (Sigma+ excitation) comes mainly from the 1st occupied Kohn-Sham state,  spin down. Then,  come excitations that are in the continuum,  or close to it (depending on the parameters of the calculation),  so,  harder to converge, In order to have a calculation converged at the level of 0.1 eV,  one needs parameters like nband 40,  ecut 10,  acell 30. In that case,  the three above-mentioned excitations become 2.388 eV (Pi),  4.432 eV (Sigma+),  5.357 eV (Sigma+). In this case,  the latter is no more the third excitation,  as other ones, coupled to the vacuum have a lower energy. These numbers can be compared to the values given by J.

Chain of Silicon diatomic molecules (4 Si2 molecules in the cell) Freeze oscillatory perturbations with different wavelengths and intensities, thanks to the qprtrb and vprtrb input variables. This should be linked with the computation of the dielectric constant, test v2#05,  that uses directly the RF capabilities of ABINIT, for one diatomic molecule. For dataset 1,  one reproduces the results obtained in Tv2#05,  multiplied by 4. The total energy is consistent up to more than 10 digits : -6.6499924738006 Ha for Tv2#05,  -26.599969895203 Ha for the present calculation. For dataset 2,  the perturbation qprtrb 0 0 1 is frozen in,  with vprtrb 100. The total energy is -26.600317638775 Ha. The difference wrt the unperturbed situation is 0.000348743572 Ha. For dataset 3,  a much smaller perturbation (10 times smaller) is taken, giving total energy -26.599973367786 Ha. The difference wrt the unperturbed situation is 0.3472583 microHa. For dataset 4,  an even smaller perturbation (100 times smaller) is taken, giving total energy -26.599969929928 Ha. The difference wrt the unperturbed situation is 0.000034725 microHa. With datasets 3 and 4,  we are in the linear regime. The previous amplitude is better for such studies. Dataset 5 is the same as 3,  with reversed amplitude. Results are similar to dataset 3. I had no sufficient time to analyze these data correctly and make the connection with the results of Tv2#05,  unfortunately. The following (also test 02 below) gives some more data,  and raise questions. There might be some problem with the use of qprtrb and vprtrb. For dataset 2,  the group of the four lowest eigenenergies (each corresponding to a different molecule) is : -0.47198  -0.46381  -0.46091  -0.45266,  whose spread is 0.01932 Ha. One might think that the maximum and minimum of the potential are separated roughly by 0.02 Ha. The value vprtrb 100 corresponds to a cosine wave whose amplitude is 100,  divided by the volume of the cell,  that is 5000 Bohr^3 : 0.02 Ha. The maximum and minimum of the potential should thus be separated by 0.04 Ha. There seems to be a factor of 2 off.

I do not understand why vprtrb 0 10.0 leads to no response. Such a sine wave should cause similar response as for the cosine wave. No time presently to investigate this problem (XG090909)

Hydrogen diatomic molecule in a cell,  close to BCC. One hydrogen atom is at the origin. The other lies initially along the 1 1 1 direction,  at a distance close to the one of the free dimer distance. The final position is the mirror with respect to the plane perpendicular to x,  passing at 1/2 0 0 . The cell parameter is less than twice the H2 interatomic distance,  so that the transition path come close to the x axis,  although it never reaches it (the closest being in the mirror plane).

### [[tests/v6/Input/t89.in]]   

Computation of phonons frequencies for metallic occupations at q=0 0 0 within PAW O2 (nsppol=1);  this test is directly inspired by test v3#75. In datasets 1-3,  one computes the total energy and forces,  without symmetries, as it should be for accurate finite-difference tests. From the reduced gradients with respect to displacements,  one can deduce a 2DTE of 149.9614 Ha. In dataset 4,  RF is computed with the Fermi energy correction, and the agreement with finite-differences of datasets 1 and 3 is good : one gets 149.9612 Ha. In dataset 5,  RF is computed with frozen Fermi energy and the disagreement with finite-differences of datasets 1 and 3 is large: one gets 124.9787 Ha.

To keep the CPU time to a reasonable level,  the responses are computed with minimal parameters (nstep and the kpoint grid are too small, ecut might be increased,  and also pawecutdg). Note: Charge neutrality is not achieved with the present dataset for Born Effective Charges, but can be easily reached by increasing some parameters;  for instance: (ngkpt 6 6 6,   ecut 40. pawecutdg 40.) gives Z(Eu)=2.5085,  Z(O)=-2.4982

LiH molecule test the use of spatial chemical potential. The molecule starts aligned along the x direction, while the Li chemical potential pulls the Li nucleus. The z coordinate of the molecule is changed from 0 to 5 Bohr. There is a linear part to the chemical potential. The energy and force should be the same in datasets 11 to 15 (without chemical potentiel). One sees that this is not completely the case. The force along z vanishes in these cases,  because the translational invariance is imposed by ABINIT. In datasets 21 to 23,  the energy should increase linearly,  and the force along z should be non-zero and constant. Small fluctuations are observed. Dataset 24 and 25 corresponds to the cubic part of the chemical potential. Dataset 26 places the molecule at a symmetric value of z. The total energy should be the same as with dataset 11,  16,  or 21.

Test cutoff of IFCs with nsphere - 1. The vibrational spectrum obtained without cutoff shows instabilities around Gamma and unphysical oscillation due to the long-range behavior. A cutoff is needed in order to recover the linear dispersion of the acoustic modes and nsphere -1 gives the first value of nsphere that does not lead to vibrational instabilites.

### [[tests/wannier90/Input/t03.in]]   

Cannot be executed in parallel (mlwfovl_qp) Si fcc,  in primitive cell (2 atoms/cell) Test of self-consistent model GW (2 iterations) following Faleev et al., [PRL 93,  126406 (2004)] followed by construction of quasiparticle maximally-localized wannier functions [Hamann & Vanderbilt, arXiv:0810.3616v1 (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)].  Cutoffs are set for test- acceptable speed,  and the results are poorly converged.  The input file is sufficiently annotated to serve as a model.  Note that well- converged GW calculations are extremely time consuming,  and in general it is advisable to run the SCGW part separately on a parallel system, and then run a separate serial job modeled on the last dataset, substituting "irdwfk" and "irdqps" for "getwfk" and "getqps, " with appropriate links to the files produced in the serial run.  Note that the _DEN file from the first dataset is also needed as input,  although the discontinued "irdden" input variable is not needed or supported. Note that acceptable names for the secondary input file needed by the wannier90 library are wannier90.win,  w90.win,  abo_DSn_w90.win (ndtset >0) and abo_w90.win (ndtset=0),  where abo is the 4th line of the .files file and n is the wannier dataset.
