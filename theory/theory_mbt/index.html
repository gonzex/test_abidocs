<p>The aim of this section is to introduce the Green&rsquo;s function formalism, 
the concept of self-energy and the set of coupled equations proposed by Hedin
whose self-consistent solution, in principle, gives the exact Green&rsquo;s function of the interacting system. </p>
<p>We mainly focus on the aspects of the theory that are important for understanding 
the different steps of the calculation and the role played by the input variables used to control the run. 
A much more consistent and rigorous introduction to the physical concept of Green&rsquo;s
function and self-energy can be found in any standard textbook on Many-Body theory, 
see for example {% cite Abrikosov %}, {% cite Fetter %} and {% cite Mattuck %} </p>

<p>The time-ordered Green&rsquo;s function <script type="math/tex">G(12)</script>, also called the propagator, defines
the probability amplitude for the propagation of an added or removed electron
in a many-body system. Since the probability amplitude is simply given by the
overlap between the final and the initial state, <script type="math/tex">G(12)</script> can be expressed as</p>
<p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> G(12) = -i \langle \Theta^N_0|T\bigl[\Psi(1)\Psi^\dagger(2)\bigr]|\Theta^N_0 \rangle
\label{eq:GreenDef} </script>
</p>
<p>where the matrix element is taken in the Heisenberg representation, <script type="math/tex">T</script> is the
time-ordering operator and the creation and annihilation field operators act
on the ground state of the <script type="math/tex">N</script>-electron many-body Hamiltonian 
(the conventions used in the equations are explained in the section on <a href="#notations">notations</a>). 
The propagator in Eq.\ref{eq:GreenDef} contains only part of
the full information carried by the many-body wave function, but it includes
the relevant portion for the study of charged excitations. 
Also, any single-particle operator acting on the system can be evaluated once the Green&rsquo;s function is known.</p>
<p>Useful physical information about the charged excitation energies of the many-
body system can be obtained by expressing the propagator in the so-called
Lehmann representation [1-2-3] {% cite Abrikosov Fetter Mattuck -A %}. 
To this purpose it is useful to introduce the following notation to denote the 
charged excitation energies of the <script type="math/tex">N</script>-electron system [5]:</p>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">E_{N}^0</script> is the ground state energy of the electron system with <script type="math/tex">N</script> electrons, 
and <script type="math/tex">i</script> is the set of quantum numbers labeling the excited states with <script type="math/tex">N \pm 1</script> electrons. 
Finally, <script type="math/tex">\mu</script> is the chemical potential of the system.
Other important quantities that will be used in the following are the so-called Lehmann amplitudes

<p>The Lehmann representation of the Green&rsquo;s function</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/Lehmann.png" /></p>
<p>makes it clear that, in the frequency domain, the time-ordered Green&rsquo;s function contains the 
complete excitation spectrum corresponding to excitations of an (N-1)-particle and an (N+1)-particle system. 
Hence, locating the poles of the Green&rsquo;s function in the complex plane provides the
information needed to interpret those processes measured in experiments in
which a single electron is inserted to or removed from the system. 
The figure below gives a schematic representation of the location of the poles of the
time-ordered Green&rsquo;s function.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/poles_G.png" /></p>
<p>Where the ionisation potential is the energy required to remove an electron
from the system, the electron affinity to add an electron, and the chemical
potential is typically taken to be in the middle of the gap. 
For a metallic system these energies are all equal to each other, and there is no gap.</p>
<p>The Dyson equation</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/G_Dyson.png" /></p>
<p>establishes a connection between the fully interacting <script type="math/tex">G</script> and the propagator, <script type="math/tex">G_0</script>, 
of an approximate non-interacting system through a (non-local, non-Hermitian and time dependent) 
potential called the self-energy, <script type="math/tex">\Sigma</script>. 
Since <script type="math/tex">G_0</script> is supposed to be known exactly, the problem of calculating <script type="math/tex">G(12)</script> has now
been reduced to the calculation of the self-energy.</p>
<p>The self-energy is not a mere mathematical device used in a roundabout way to
obtain <script type="math/tex">G</script> but is has a direct physical meaning. 
The knowledge of the self-energy operator, allows one to describe the quantum-mechanical state of a
renormalized electron in the many-body system by solving the quasiparticle (QP) equation[5]:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/qp_equation.png" /></p>
<p>The QP eigenstates so obtained can be used to construct <script type="math/tex">G</script> according to the Lehmann representation. 
Note that the QP equation departs from the Kohn Sham equation since the QP eigenvectors and eigenvalues 
do have a direct physical meaning: they can be used to obtain both the charge density of the interacting
system and to describe the properties of charged excitations.  </p>

<p>In 1965 Hedin {% cite Hedin1965 %} showed how to derive a set of coupled integro-differential
equations whose self-consistent solution, in principle, gives the exact self-energy of the system 
and therefore the exact <script type="math/tex">G</script>.
The fundamental building blocks employed in the formalism are the irreducible polarizability:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/tchi_def.png" /></p>
<p>which describes the linear response of the density to changes in the total
effective potential (the superposition of the external potential plus the
internal classical Hartree potential) and the dynamically screened interaction, <script type="math/tex">W</script>, 
that is related to the bare Coulomb interaction, <script type="math/tex">v</script>, and to the inverse dielectric function through:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/W_def.png" /></p>
<p>The dielectric matrix <script type="math/tex">\varepsilon(12)</script> is related to the irreducible polarizability
<script type="math/tex">\chi(12)</script> by the following relation:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/e_from_tchi.png" /></p>
<p>The pentagon sketched in the figure below shows how the various physical quantities are interrelated:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/hedin_pentagon.png" /></p>
<p>The polarization function renormalises the bare interaction resulting in the screened interaction <script type="math/tex">W(12)</script>. 
The screened interaction, <script type="math/tex">W(12)</script>, the many-body propagator <script type="math/tex">G(12)</script>, and the vertex function, <script type="math/tex">\Gamma(12;3)</script>, 
which describe the interactions between virtual hole and electron excitations [5], are the
essential ingredients for the determination of <script type="math/tex">\Sigma(12)</script>.</p>
<p>The iteration starts by setting <script type="math/tex">G = G_0</script>. Then the set of equations should
in principle be iterated until self-consistency in all terms is reached.  </p>

<h3 id="the-gw-approximation">The <script type="math/tex">GW</script> approximation.<a class="headerlink" href="#the-gw-approximation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The practical solution of Hedin&rsquo;s equations is extremely complicated as they
are not just numerical relations but contain a functional derivative in the equation for the vertex. 
The direct evaluation of the vertex function is very challenging. 
The set of equations can, however, be iterated assuming that only
a few iterations are actually needed to obtain physically meaningful results.</p>
<p>A widely used approach to the approximate solution of Hedin&rsquo;s equations is the
so-called <script type="math/tex">GW</script> approximation[6], which consists in approximating the vertex
function with a local and instantaneous function:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/gamma_GW.png" /></p>
<p>This approximated vertex, once inserted in the full set of Hedin&rsquo;s equations,
leads to a considerable simplification in the set of equations:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/gw_pentagon.png" /></p>
<p>Thanks to the neglect of vertex corrections, the irreducible polarizability <script type="math/tex">\chi(12)</script> is now given by</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/RPA_chi.png" /></p>
<p>which, once rewritten in terms of orbitals and energies, reduces to the RPA expression 
proposed by Adler [7] and Wiser [8].</p>
<p>In real space, the self-energy reduces to a simple direct product of the
dressed electron propagator, <script type="math/tex">G(12)</script>, and the dynamically screened interaction, <script type="math/tex">W(12)</script>:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/gwsigma_rt_domain.png" /></p>
<p>The self-energy, a simple product in the space-time domain, becomes a
convolution when expressed in frequency-space:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/self_def.png" /></p>
<p>Ideally, the set of <script type="math/tex">GW</script> equations should still be iterated until self-consistency in all terms is reached; 
this is the fully self-consistent <script type="math/tex">GW</script> method (<script type="math/tex">SCGW</script>).<br />
However <script type="math/tex">SCGW</script> calculations for real systems are still very challenging, and very few have been reported in the literature.<br />
Moreover, the utility of fully <script type="math/tex">SCGW</script> results are still under debate within the scientific community.</p>
<p>The problem is that self-consistency typically improves total energies, but
worsens spectral properties (such as band gaps and optical spectra). 
Since obtaining the spectral information is often the main reason for doing such
difficult calculations in the first place, many authors agree that a useful
self-consistent approach would need the inclusion of some kind of vertex
correction during the solution of the equations.</p>
<p>For this reason, the most common approach employed in the ab-initio
community consists of using the best available approximation for <script type="math/tex">G</script> and <script type="math/tex">W</script>
as a starting point and performing only a single-iteration of the parallelogram 
(the so-called one-shot <script type="math/tex">GW</script> method, or <script type="math/tex">G_0W_0</script>). 
In this case the self-energy is simply given by:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/G0W0.png" /></p>
<p>where <script type="math/tex">G_0^{\text{KS}}(12)</script> is the independent-particle propagator of the Kohn-Sham (<script type="math/tex">KS</script>)
Hamiltonian, and the screened interaction is approximated with the RPA calculated with  KS energies and wave functions:</p>

<h3 id="perturbative-approach">Perturbative approach.<a class="headerlink" href="#perturbative-approach" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Despite all the fundamental differences between many-body theory and DFT, the
Kohn-Sham exchange-correlation potential can be seen as a static, local and Hermitian approximation to the self-energy. 
Indeed, in many cases the Kohn-Sham energies already provide a reasonable estimate of the band structure and
are usually in qualitative agreement with experiment.</p>
<p>This observation suggests that a simple, albeit accurate, solution for the QP
energies can be obtained using first-order perturbation theory, treating the
exchange and correlation potential, <script type="math/tex">V_{\text{xc}}</script>, as a zeroth-order approximation to
the non-local and energy dependent self-energy [11,12]</p>
<p>Under the assumption that the QP wavefunctions equal the KS orbitals, we can
expand the self-energy operator around <script type="math/tex">\epsilon\_{\text{KS}}</script> obtaining a 
closed expression for <script type="math/tex">\epsilon_{\text{QP}}</script>:</p>

<p>where</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/Z_def.png" /></p>
<p>is the so-called renormalization factor. 
This corresponds to making a Taylor expansion of the self-energy matrix element 
around the KS energy, as depicted below.</p>

<p>In the reciprocal space and frequency domain (implying a Fourier transform

<p>The number of bands used to compute the polarizability is specified by <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#nband">nband</a>
while <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#zcut">zcut</a> gives the small complex shift used to avoid the divergences in the denominators.

<script type="math/tex">M</script> is a shorthand notation to denote the matrix element of a plane wave
sandwiched between two wavefunctions (i.e. oscillator matrix elements). 
The number of planewaves (PW) used to describe the wavefunctions is determined by <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#ecutwfn">ecutwfn</a>
while the number of <script type="math/tex">\GG</script>-vectors used to describe the polarizability (i.e. the
number of <script type="math/tex">\GG</script> vectors in the oscillator matrix elements) is determined by <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#ecuteps">ecuteps</a>.
The oscillators are ubiquitous in the Many-Body part of ABINIT and their
calculation represents one of the most CPU intensive part of the execution.
For this reason we devote this <a href="../theory_mbt.html#oscillator_notes">section</a> to the
discussion of some important technical details concerning their computation.</p>
<p>In principle, the set of <script type="math/tex">\qq</script>-points in the screening matrix is given by all
the possible differences between two crystalline momenta of the wavefunctions
stored in the WFK file, so it is controlled by the chosen <script type="math/tex">\kk</script>-point grid.
The code, however, exploits the invariance of the two-point function under the
action of any symmetry operation of the crystalline space group:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/chi0_symmetry.png" />  </p>
<p>so that only the <script type="math/tex">\qq</script>-points in the irreducible Brillouin zone (IBZ) have to
be calculated explicitly.</p>
<p>In frequency and reciprocal space, the microscopic dielectric function is
related to the irreducible polarizability by the following relation</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/epsilon_vs_tchi.png" /></p>
<p>from which the inverse dielectric function is obtained via matrix inversion.
Following Adler [7,8], the macroscopic dielectric function, <script type="math/tex">\varepsilon^M_{LF}(\omega)</script>, can be
directly related to the inverse of the microscopic dielectric matrix by means of:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/emacro_lfe.png" /></p>
<p>The optical absorption spectrum &ndash; the quantity one can compare with
experiments &ndash; is given by the imaginary part: <script type="math/tex">\Im[\varepsilon^M_{LF}(\omega)]</script>.</p>
<p>Note that the equation above differs from</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/emacro_nlfe.png" /></p>
<p>due to the so called local-field effects introduced by the presence of the crystalline environment. 
These spectra, if calculated, are typically output as <code>\_LF</code> and <code>\_NLF</code> files during the course of a calculation.  </p>

<p>Many body calculations require the evaluation of integrals involving the oscillator matrix elements</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/oscillator_longv.png" /></p>
<p>where the <script type="math/tex">\kk</script>-point belongs to the full Brillouin zone.</p>
<p>These terms are evaluated by performing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the
real space product of the two wavefunctions (the second expression in the equation above). 
Thanks to the FFT algorithm, the CPU-time requirement scales
almost linearly with the number of points in the FFT box, moreover the
code implements refined algorithms (for instance zero-padded FFTs, FFTW3
interface) to optimize the computation.</p>
<p>There can be a significant speed-up in this component depending on the
numerical FFT library used. If possible, it should always be advantageous to
link and use the FFTW3 library in <script type="math/tex">GW</script> calculations (controlled by setting <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vardev/#fftalg">fftalg</a> 312). 
The performance of the various FFT libraries for a given type of
calculation can be benchmarked with the <code>fftprof</code> utility.</p>
<p>For a given set of indeces (<script type="math/tex">b\_1</script>, <script type="math/tex">b\_2</script>, <script type="math/tex">\kk</script>, <script type="math/tex">\qq</script>), the calculation of the
oscillator is done in four different steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The two wavefunctions in the irreducible wedge are FFT transformed from the <script type="math/tex">\GG</script>-space to the real space representation, </li>
<li>The orbitals are rotated in real space on the FFT mesh to obtain the points <script type="math/tex">\kk</script> and <script type="math/tex">\kk-\qq</script> in the full Brillouin zone. </li>
<li>Computation of the wavefunction product. </li>
<li>FFT transform of the product to obtain <script type="math/tex">M</script>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each oscillator thus requires three different FFTs (two transforms to
construct the product, one FFT to get <script type="math/tex">M</script>). The number of FFTs can be
significantly reduced by precomputing and storing in memory the real space
representation of the orbitals at the price of a reasonable increase of the
memory allocated. However, for very memory demanding calculations, the real
space orbitals can be calculated on the fly with an increase in computational time instead. 
This option is controlled by the second digit of the input variable <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#gwmem">gwmem</a></p>
<p>The third term in the equation defining the oscillators makes it clear that
the product of the periodic part of the orbitals has non-zero Fourier
components in a sphere whose radius is 2�<em>Rwfn</em> where <em>Rwfn</em> is the radius of
the <script type="math/tex">\GG</script>-sphere used for the wavefunctions (set by <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#ecutwfn">ecutwfn</a>).
To avoid aliasing errors in the FFT one should therefore use an FFT box that encloses the sphere with
radius <script type="math/tex">2 R_{\text{wfn}</script>, but this leads to a significant increase in the computing
effort as well as in the memory requirements. 
The input variable [[fftgw] specifies how to setup the FFT box for the oscillators and should be used to
test how the aliasing errors affect the final results. 
The default setting of <code>fftgw 21</code> is safe, a setting of <code>fftgw 11</code> is fast but can be inaccurate,
and a setting of <code>fftgw 31</code> gives the maximum possible accuracy at a significant computational cost.  </p>

<h3 id="the-hilbert-transform-method">The Hilbert transform method.<a class="headerlink" href="#the-hilbert-transform-method" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The computational effort for the evaluation of the RPA polarizability with the
Adler-Wiser expression scales linearly with the number of frequencies computed (<a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#nfreqre">nfreqre</a>, <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#nfreqim">nfreqim</a>)
albeit with a large prefactor which increases with the fourth power of the number of atoms. 
The main reason for the linear scaling is that the frequency dependence cannot be factorised out 
of the sum over transitions, hence a distinct and expensive summation over transitions has to be performed
separately for each frequency.</p>
<p>This linear scaling represents a serious problem, especially when many
frequencies are wanted, for example when computing QP corrections within the
contour deformation technique described in the <a href="../lesson_gw2.html">second lesson</a> of the <script type="math/tex">GW</script> tutorial.</p>
<p>This computational bottleneck can be removed, under certain circumstances, by
employing an efficient algorithm proposed in [13] and subsequently revisited
in [14], in which only the spectral function</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/sf_chi0.png" /></p>
<p>has to be evaluated in terms of electronic transitions between valence and
conduction states. The Dirac delta function can be approximated either by
means of a triangular function centered at the energy transition following
[14] or a gaussian approximant following [13] 
(see the related input variables <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#spmeth">spmeth</a> and <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#spbroad">spbroad</a>.
The spectral function is evaluated on a linear frequency mesh which
covers the entire set of transition energies included in the calculation. 
The number of points in the mesh is given by <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#nomegasf">nomegasf</a>.</p>
<p>The evaluation of the spectral function is rather efficient thanks to the
presence of the delta-function in the expression above. For example, when
<a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#spmeth">spmeth</a> = 1, the CPU time required to compute the spectral function on an arbitrarily dense
frequency mesh is just twice that required by a single static computation
based on the standard Adler-Wiser expression.</p>
<p>The full polarizability is then efficiently retrieved by means of a less
expensive frequency integration (a Hilbert transform):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/hilbert_transform.png" /></p>
<p>The price to be paid, however, is that a large table for the spectral function
has to be stored in memory and a Hilbert transform has to be performed for
each pair (<script type="math/tex">\GG_1</script>, <script type="math/tex">\GG_2</script>). Since the computing time required for the
transform scales quadratically with the number of vectors in the
polarizability (governed by <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#ecuteps">ecuteps</a>, the CPU time spent in this part will overcome
the computing time of the standard Adler-Wiser formalism for large <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#ecuteps">ecuteps</a>.
A theoretical estimate of the crossover point is hard to give because it
depends on many factors. However, if many frequencies are needed, such as for
the evaluation of optical spectra, or accurate contour deformation
integrations, or even mapping full grids in the complex plane, the Hilbert
transform method can be significantly faster, and its use is well worth considering.  </p>

<p>Following the standard approach, we separate the screened interaction into the
static bare Coulomb term and a frequency-dependent contribution according to:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/W_partition_simple.png" /></p>
<p>where matrix notation is used.</p>
<p>This particular decomposition of <script type="math/tex">W</script>, once inserted in the convolution
defining <script type="math/tex">\Sigma</script>, leads to the split of the self-energy into two different
contributions (exchange and correlation):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/self_energy.png" /></p>
<p>The exchange part is static and turns out to have the same mathematical
structure as the Fock operator in Hartree-Fock theory, albeit constructed with
quasiparticle amplitudes</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/self_x.png" /></p>
<p>while the dynamic part <script type="math/tex">\Sigma_c(\omega)</script> accounts for correlation effects beyond <script type="math/tex">\Sigma_x</script>.</p>
<p>It is important to stress that, for computational efficiency, the code does
not compute the full self-energy operator by default. Only its matrix elements
for the states specified by <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#kptgw">kptgw</a> and <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#bdgw">bdgw</a> are computed and used to obtain the QP corrections.</p>
<p>When expressed in reciprocal space, the diagonal matrix elements of the
exchange part are given by:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/self_x_mel.png" /></p>
<p>The evaluation of these terms represents a minor fraction of the overall CPU
time since only occupied states are involved. However we should always keep in
mind that, due to the long range of the bare Coulomb interaction, the
convergence with respect to the number of plane waves used in the oscillators
<script type="math/tex">M</script> (<a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#ecutsigx">ecutsigx</a> is usually slow, much slower than the convergence of the correlation
part, which is short-ranged. This plane wave cutoff can be converged
independently of others if neceessary, and given a much larger value in
comparison to <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#ecut">ecut</a>, <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#ecutwfn">ecutwfn</a> and <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#ecuteps">ecuteps</a>.</p>
<p>Another point worth noting is the presence in the expression of the Coulomb
singularity for <script type="math/tex">|\qq+\GG| \rightarrow 0</script>. From a mathematical point of view, the
integral is well-defined since the singularity is integrable in three-
dimensional space once the thermodynamical limit, <script type="math/tex">N_\qq \rightarrow \infty</script>, is reached. On
the other hand, only a finite number of <script type="math/tex">\qq</script>-points can be used for practical
applications, and a careful numerical treatment is needed to avoid an
exceedingly slow convergence with respect to the BZ sampling. To accelerate
the convergence in the number of <script type="math/tex">\qq</script>-points, the code implements several
techniques proposed in the literature. 
We refer to the documentation of <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#icutcoul">icutcoul</a> for a more extensive discussion.</p>
<p>The expression for the matrix elements of the correlation part is instead given by:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/self_c_mel.png" /></p>
<p>where all dynamical effects are now contained in the frequency convolution integral <script type="math/tex">J</script>.</p>
<p>The explicit expression for <script type="math/tex">J</script> depends on the method used to treat the
screened interaction. The code implements four different plasmon-pole
techniques to model the frequency dependence of <script type="math/tex">W</script> in an efficient but
approximate way, alternatively, it is possible to use the more sophisticated
frequency integration of the contour deformation method [15] for accurate QP
calculations (see the related variables <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#ppmodel">ppmodel</a> and <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#gwcalctyp">gwcalctyp</a>.</p>
<p>The double sum over <script type="math/tex">\GG</script>-vectors is performed for all the plane waves
contained within a sphere of energy <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#ecuteps">ecuteps</a>
(it cannot be larger than the value used to generate the SCR file). For each
state, the correlated matrix elements are evaluated on a linear frequency mesh
centered around the initial KS energy and the derivative needed for the
renormalization factor is obtained numerically (see <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#nomegasrd">nomegasrd</a> and <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#omegasrdmax">omegasrdmax</a>)</p>
<p>Note that here, in contrast to the exchange term, the sum over the band index
<script type="math/tex">n</script> should extend up to infinity although in practice only a finite number of
states can be used (specified by <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varbas/#nband">nband</a>).</p>

<p>One of the major computational efforts in self-energy calculations is
represented by the calculation of the frequency dependence of the screened
interaction, which is needed for the evaluation of the convolution. Due to the
ragged behavior of <script type="math/tex">G(\omega)</script> and <script type="math/tex">W(\omega)</script> along the real axis, numerous real
frequencies are in principle required to converge the results (note that the
maximum frequencies needed are now reported if <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/varfil/#prtvol">prtvol</a> &gt; 9). 
On the other hand, since the fine details of <script type="math/tex">W(\omega)</script> are integrated over,
it is reasonable to expect that approximate models, able to capture the main
physical features of the screened interaction, should give sufficiently
accurate results with a considerably reduction of computational effort. This
is the basic idea behind the so-called plasmon-pole models in which the

<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/ppmodel_imag.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/ppmodel_real.png" /></p>
<p>The two models differ in the approach used to compute the parameters. 
<a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#ppmodel">ppmodel</a> = 1 derives the parameters such that the inverse dielectric matrix is correctly
reproduced at two different explicitly calculated frequencies: the static
limit (<script type="math/tex">\omega=0</script>) and an additional imaginary point located at <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#ppmfrq">ppmfrq</a>.
Unless the user overrides this, the default value is calculated from the
average electronic density of the system. The plasmon-pole parameters of <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#ppmodel">ppmodel</a> = 2
are calculated so as to reproduce the static limit exactly and to fulfill a
generalized frequency sum rule relating the imaginary part of the many-body
inverse dielectric matrix to the plasma frequency and the charge density [12]</p>
<p>For a discussion of the models corresponding to <a class="wikilink" href="../../input_variables/vargw/#ppmodel">ppmodel</a> = 3,4
we refer the reader to the original papers cited in the documentation of the variable.  </p>

<h3 id="contour-deformation-technique">Contour deformation technique.<a class="headerlink" href="#contour-deformation-technique" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The contour deformation method was proposed in order to avoid having to deal
with quantities close to the real axis as much as possible [15]. The integral
over the real frequency axis can be transformed into an integral over the
contour depicted in red in the figure below. The integral over real frequency
is traded with an integration along the imaginary axis plus contributions
coming from the poles of the integrand lying inside the contour:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/contour.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/GW_CD.png" /></p>
<p>In the above equation, the first sum is restricted to the poles lying inside
the path <script type="math/tex">C</script>. <script type="math/tex">W_c(z)</script> represents the frequency dependent part of the
screened interaction, whose expression in reciprocal space is given by:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/Wc.png" /></p>
<p>The integration along the imaginary axis is expected to converge quickly with
respect to the number of sampled frequencies since the integrand is typically
very smooth. Only the residues of the integrand have to be evaluated at the
complex poles contributed by the Green&rsquo;s function whose frequency dependence
is known.  </p>

<h3 id="notations">Notations<a class="headerlink" href="#notations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The following shorthand notations are employed:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/notation_1.png" /></p>
<p>where <script type="math/tex">v(\rr_1, \rr_2)</script> represents the bare Coulomb interaction, and <script type="math/tex">\eta</script> is a
positive infinitesimal.</p>
<p>The Fourier transforms for periodic lattice quantities are defined as</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../theory_mbt/notation_2.png" /></p>
<p>The volume of the unit cell is denoted with <script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>, while <script type="math/tex">V</script> is the total volume
of the crystal simulated employing Born-von Karman periodic boundary
condition. Unless otherwise specified, Hartree atomic units will be used throughout.</p>
